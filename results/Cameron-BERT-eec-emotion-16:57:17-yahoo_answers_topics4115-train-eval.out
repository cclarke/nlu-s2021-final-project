Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 1.3794, -1.9606,  0.2166,  2.5983, -2.9072])
  | tensor([ 3.3806, -2.9708,  1.2697,  0.5651, -2.7551])
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. | tensor([-1.0011,  0.4156, -0.2288, -2.7898,  3.1604])
Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 2.0813, -0.5031, -0.6898, -0.3297, -1.1564])
 \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. | tensor([-1.3257,  1.3049,  0.8587, -2.4316,  1.2760])
 Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. | tensor([-1.5024,  0.7867,  1.9066, -1.4076,  0.3688])
When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly. | tensor([-0.2306,  0.6250, -0.2189, -2.0499,  1.3676])

Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. | tensor([ 3.2779, -1.5511, -2.0886,  1.5605, -1.6690])
The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises "bad" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. | tensor([-2.6346,  0.0398,  1.0684, -2.2347,  4.2587])
\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. | tensor([-1.1599, -1.0889,  4.6393, -3.2482,  0.5982])
In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods. | tensor([ 2.6625, -0.9184, -0.0165, -1.6684, -0.8856])

from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. | tensor([-0.7993, -0.8597, -0.7661,  5.8736, -3.6415])
It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "fight or flight" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. | tensor([-2.6204,  4.2905,  0.7407,  0.7211, -2.9325])
<br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. | tensor([-3.3971,  3.2396,  3.9918, -3.6162,  0.8005])
As a result of the "fight or flight" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. | tensor([-2.6789,  4.5764, -1.4225, -2.5568,  1.8736])
\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. | tensor([-2.9368,  6.4941, -0.8463, -2.1357, -0.1128])
The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. | tensor([-3.0092,  3.7328,  0.9275, -4.3586,  2.9546])
\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. | tensor([-1.6112,  4.8649, -1.9799,  1.0821, -2.6702])
So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness. | tensor([-1.0584e+00, -2.5094e+00,  5.9351e-03,  6.4429e+00, -2.5421e+00])

Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film "Tango & Cash". | tensor([ 1.2734, -1.7884, -0.5772,  5.1676, -4.0072])
After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. | tensor([ 3.9271, -0.1400,  0.7414, -3.1022, -2.0786])

A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. | tensor([-2.0466, -1.6668,  2.1875, -3.7743,  5.8801])
Since you asked "how the human species evolved? | tensor([ 4.8804, -1.9643, -1.2449,  0.3402, -2.4420])
" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. | tensor([ 4.9609, -2.0045, -0.3122, -0.7805, -2.7549])
Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. | tensor([ 2.1124, -2.8058, -0.6132,  3.1981, -2.2333])
The pressures for "fit" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). | tensor([ 0.2204, -3.8611,  0.4120,  2.7727,  0.5347])
These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology. | tensor([ 0.2601, -2.5039, -2.3531,  6.9866, -2.7714])
That is kind of a tricky little quote. | tensor([-2.2993,  2.0424,  3.9816, -2.4250, -0.8534])
Sometimes placing it in context can help. | tensor([-0.7015, -2.6111, -1.5776,  7.3528, -2.1229])
This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self Reliance," which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). | tensor([-1.4678,  2.4882,  0.2750, -2.9914,  1.1224])
\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. | tensor([-1.1298, -2.5865, -2.1020,  8.1253, -2.0789])
  | tensor([ 3.3806, -2.9708,  1.2697,  0.5651, -2.7551])
It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the "independence of solitude"). | tensor([-2.0728, -3.6450,  0.5800,  4.8907,  1.1712])
However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. | tensor([-0.1468, -2.8816,  1.0989,  3.3093, -1.4396])
Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a "finished man" can truly do. | tensor([-1.1279, -3.5026, -1.7373,  5.5797,  1.1637])
Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. | tensor([-2.6659,  2.8941, -1.2184,  0.9001,  0.3436])

The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. | tensor([ 3.0302, -1.5428,  2.3085, -1.6254, -2.9135])
It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. | tensor([ 2.5596, -2.8250,  0.9349,  1.9261, -3.2049])
Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in. | tensor([ 4.9769, -1.7874, -1.3587, -1.1638, -1.8393])

There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\nNow, to get more generalized... | tensor([-1.2642, -1.4535,  1.5057,  2.5594, -0.8461])

On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state. | tensor([-1.3987, -1.7984,  3.2146,  3.0024, -2.5857])
  | tensor([ 3.3806, -2.9708,  1.2697,  0.5651, -2.7551])
With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals. | tensor([-0.7680, -2.7464, -1.5946,  5.8235, -0.8132])

Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n\n    primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned\n\n    means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and\n\n    means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units. | tensor([ 4.5565, -1.5809, -1.4429,  0.3435, -2.5356])

It's a recently developed concept of the general public categorizing information according to what's most useful for the masses, and is considered in opposition to the sometimes more formal classification systems created by an entity such as the Library of Congress or Yahoo!.\n\nFolksonomies are often implemented using tags.   | tensor([ 3.2525, -0.4925, -0.8724, -0.2740, -2.2470])
An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item, rather than having to decide which category to place the item in. | tensor([-0.0519, -1.2563, -0.0038,  2.3932, -0.9090])

Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. | tensor([ 4.0496, -2.1484, -1.5523,  1.4843, -2.2852])
It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). | tensor([ 5.5035, -2.2262, -1.8283,  0.9104, -2.7032])
Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. | tensor([ 4.6791, -2.4434, -1.8390,  1.6823, -2.3501])
At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. | tensor([-0.2526, -1.9311, -1.9389,  5.8422, -1.6466])
This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. | tensor([-2.0252,  4.3618, -1.4281, -2.6384,  1.2399])
Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. | tensor([ 5.5883, -2.0089, -2.3187,  0.6054, -2.3539])

Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. | tensor([ 1.4386, -0.0834,  0.8766, -3.7518,  0.7095])
Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. | tensor([ 4.7231, -2.0167, -1.4590,  0.8626, -2.5117])
Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. | tensor([ 3.2188, -2.1906, -1.7397,  2.5893, -2.0506])

FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. | tensor([ 3.0013, -3.0824, -0.5980,  3.1134, -2.8471])

But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. | tensor([ 4.6225, -1.9033, -0.2183, -0.3579, -2.8746])

The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. | tensor([ 0.9246,  0.6144,  0.4010, -0.5552, -1.7336])

  | tensor([ 3.3806, -2.9708,  1.2697,  0.5651, -2.7551])
When such a cloud formation has an influx of water/ice, ie it's mass increases to include more water/ice, light finds it hard to pass through the mass, thus making it darker for us to see.\n\nIn a normal cloud, light can pass through the water/ice within the cloud and we see it as a distorted white/bluish/greyish/greenish hue. | tensor([-1.0435,  1.3537, -0.4683, -2.8122,  1.9121])

This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). | tensor([ 4.5231, -1.8633, -1.5817, -0.7588, -0.8578])

\n\nThe reason for the celebration is twofold (both dating back to c. 165 BCE): \n\nthe miraculous military victory of the small, ill-equipped Jewish army over the ruling Greek Syrians, who had banned the Jewish religion and desecrated the Temple; \n\nand the miracle of the small cruse of consecrated oil, which burned for eight days in the Temple's menorah instead of just one. \n\n\nHanukkah is celebrated by: \n\na. lighting a menorah for eight nights with olive oil or wax candles; one on the first night and an additional one each succeeding night \n\nb. | tensor([ 4.1903, -1.7133, -1.7839,  1.5565, -2.6743])

As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. | tensor([ 4.1304, -1.2978, -2.8818,  1.0602, -1.4067])

Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a "feed").\n\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. | tensor([ 2.7177, -3.3744,  0.2419,  2.7099, -2.6061])

Free readers are available as well; a search for "RSS Reader" at popular search sites will yield many results.\n\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). | tensor([ 3.9717, -2.1732, -1.8000,  2.5870, -2.9334])

Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. | tensor([-0.1134, -2.4637,  1.0303,  5.2692, -3.7222])
The trade-off made is convenience for speed. | tensor([-0.7857, -2.6550,  2.2152,  4.4792, -3.3597])
Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. | tensor([ 3.1692, -1.2679, -0.5833,  0.5110, -2.5936])
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. | tensor([ 2.9865, -0.8565, -1.0119,  0.9125, -2.3222])
Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. | tensor([ 1.3738, -2.0712,  0.8339,  2.5720, -3.0609])
Their work has yet to be completed. | tensor([ 3.1416, -2.7136,  0.0845, -2.1966,  0.6345])
The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. | tensor([ 1.1739, -2.2482, -1.3274,  2.5659, -0.4530])
Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. | tensor([ 1.0070, -3.2375,  1.4242,  3.6541, -2.5078])
Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. | tensor([ 2.0095, -2.1555, -0.8700,  2.4249, -2.0111])
Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. | tensor([ 4.3867, -2.4653, -0.2625,  0.2696, -2.2405])
These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. | tensor([-2.9297,  3.7032,  0.1950, -3.0483,  2.0892])
If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. | tensor([ 1.6544, -0.3170,  1.5150, -3.3513, -0.6021])
This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. | tensor([ 1.3606, -0.6907, -0.4805, -0.1383, -0.9478])
The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. | tensor([-0.6253, -3.1493, -2.3073,  6.7615, -0.5736])
This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. | tensor([-2.8836, -0.5890,  2.0921, -2.6643,  4.7702])
Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. | tensor([ 1.6876, -3.0244, -1.4919,  4.5441, -1.9320])
The setup would most likely begin with a router. | tensor([ 1.2131, -1.9289,  2.1770,  0.8450, -2.4172])
This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. | tensor([-0.0206, -1.8129,  2.4190,  1.2627, -1.9430])
There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. | tensor([ 0.0014,  0.1026,  1.2852, -0.6276, -1.1321])
These allow any wired device to be included on the network. | tensor([-0.5834, -1.1080,  1.7727,  1.2050, -1.5933])
The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) | tensor([ 4.8745, -1.4256, -1.4434, -0.3309, -2.5007])
Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\n\n\nAdvantages/Conclusions\n\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. | tensor([ 9.3087e-04, -3.4036e+00, -6.8372e-01,  5.3599e+00, -1.6280e+00])
It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. | tensor([ 0.9728, -1.8707,  1.5408,  2.2032, -3.1734])
Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. | tensor([-1.2210,  0.0831,  3.9048, -2.9868, -0.0644])
If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. | tensor([ 0.4741, -0.9693,  1.0487,  1.2219, -1.8261])
The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. | tensor([-0.2383, -2.6529,  4.9564,  0.4360, -1.9596])
Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. | tensor([-2.0801, -0.7844,  8.0697, -2.8836, -2.0186])

Only then should 802.11n be considered. | tensor([ 0.5322, -1.2374,  2.6865, -0.6478, -1.4047])

Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). | tensor([ 4.1665, -2.5843, -0.9554,  0.9567, -2.3987])
The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. | tensor([ 2.8550, -3.9558, -1.2453,  3.3694, -0.8663])
We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. | tensor([-0.3828, -2.5936, -1.4923,  7.6503, -3.4973])
It is contained in our mitochandria. | tensor([ 4.4908, -2.1721, -1.2366,  0.2712, -2.3249])
Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. | tensor([ 3.6397, -1.8086, -0.7481,  0.0969, -1.8489])
The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. | tensor([ 5.5902, -1.7945, -1.2270, -2.3358, -1.1235])
So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. | tensor([-0.2679, -2.0455,  0.1746,  1.4423,  0.5471])
Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. | tensor([-0.7655, -0.8838,  2.5004, -4.5568,  3.2399])
Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. | tensor([ 3.3948, -2.8845,  0.6131,  0.6882, -2.2329])
So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. | tensor([ 2.2380,  1.4814, -1.2473, -1.8013, -1.8567])
These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. | tensor([ 1.6636, -1.4421,  1.7139, -3.0976,  0.2667])

The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. | tensor([ 1.2255, -3.7646,  0.9675, -2.2786,  3.1078])
If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. | tensor([-1.7008, -0.8806,  3.4554, -3.7242,  2.5336])
More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. | tensor([ 0.8802, -3.9811,  1.4818,  4.1985, -2.8836])

Passion\n\nI've received the question about motivation to workout several times. | tensor([-0.8515, -2.4798,  0.1605,  5.5047, -2.5227])
A bit back, I emailed a fellow who simply wished the question of motivation could be answered.\n\nI think the 2 most frequently asked questions that I address in my Beginners' Guide to Fitness and Bodybuilding are:\n\n1) | tensor([ 2.5596, -0.8932, -0.8367,  0.6373, -2.3616])
How do I get motivated?\n2) | tensor([-0.0723, -1.8385,  1.2936,  3.3358, -3.1786])
How soon can I expect to see results?\n\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\n\nPassion\n\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\n\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. | tensor([-1.8746, -1.2113,  3.9813, -3.4722,  2.7716])
Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. | tensor([-0.7975, -3.1924, -0.9910,  7.8392, -2.7064])
Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\n\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. | tensor([-0.7281, -2.7898, -1.3828,  7.5856, -2.6166])
It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. | tensor([-1.0945, -2.4981, -2.2937,  8.1659, -2.2741])
Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. | tensor([-0.9114, -2.9500, -0.6579,  7.4499, -2.8443])
So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. | tensor([ 1.0967, -3.5208, -1.2806,  6.3573, -2.6879])
Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. | tensor([-1.0286, -2.9738, -1.0035,  7.7466, -2.6592])
In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\n\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out. | tensor([-2.2439, -0.7920, -1.6709,  3.5918,  1.8013])

I would suggest conducting a search in your area for "technical temp agencies" or contacting a local employment recruiter to ask about technical temp agencies in your locale. | tensor([ 6.0292, -1.7636, -1.2845, -1.2047, -2.2836])

It may actually hurt you FICO score.\n\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. | tensor([ 2.2037, -0.2398, -1.9314, -1.1259,  0.3154])
So, let's take a look at an example:\n\n$200 total credit available\n$175 total credit used\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\n\n$5000 total credit available\n$1000 total credit used\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\n\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. | tensor([-0.6926, -3.7416,  1.0335,  4.2459, -0.8659])
Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\n\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. | tensor([ 4.8745, -1.0902, -1.4313, -2.3023, -0.9408])
So it doesn’t matter what you do with them as long as you don’t stop paying them.\n\nIt’s best to just hold on to them. | tensor([ 9.6442e-04, -2.4520e+00, -4.4861e-02,  2.7225e+00,  2.8362e-02])
You might even consider having the credit limit taken up (but don’t max them out). | tensor([ 3.2682, -1.6782, -1.0638,  0.3374, -1.4212])
It’s not how much of a limit you have that’s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you’re | tensor([-0.3215, -1.7866,  1.1935,  0.9913,  0.1399])
using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. | tensor([ 3.8841, -1.4919, -1.6232, -2.5736,  1.3403])
To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you’re likely to just cancel it. | tensor([-0.7171,  1.2180,  1.3836, -4.1959,  2.1816])
Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you’re worth.\n\nHope this helps. | tensor([-0.6922, -0.5943, -3.9157,  2.4219,  2.6694])

He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity... | tensor([-3.5144,  3.5035,  0.8853, -2.8083,  2.2387])

Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of "bad nasties". | tensor([-3.2362,  3.0096,  2.9311, -4.1657,  1.8865])
I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store... | tensor([ 5.7261, -1.6882, -1.3216, -1.3287, -2.0814])

It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. | tensor([-2.4928,  2.5114, -3.0885, -2.3202,  6.0462])
But it just hit me oddly. | tensor([-2.4095, -2.7546,  4.6359,  3.2907, -1.3380])
I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it... | tensor([-1.2142, -0.6769,  0.3329,  2.0125, -0.3692])
that's what started the whole process. | tensor([-1.2132, -2.1765, -1.1028,  7.3862, -2.6825])

So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want... | tensor([ 2.3509, -1.2885, -0.3545,  0.6218, -1.8058])
I'm not kidding. | tensor([-0.1951,  2.8027,  0.2798, -1.4972, -1.8289])
True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating | tensor([-0.2146, -1.3602,  0.5793,  2.6833, -1.6415])
but I also don't beat myself up about it. | tensor([-3.6609,  2.1925, -1.1041, -1.6412,  4.5113])
If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. | tensor([ 2.0958, -0.6481, -1.5999,  1.9573, -2.5799])
When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. | tensor([-0.7802, -0.6378,  1.3899, -0.3076,  0.7117])
The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. | tensor([-0.0222, -1.6072, -0.4643,  2.3938, -0.3157])
I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. | tensor([-2.2917,  0.0803,  1.7425,  0.4138,  0.0476])
As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. | tensor([ 0.3372, -2.8198, -1.4077,  6.9540, -3.3440])
So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. | tensor([-1.1355, -2.5282, -1.6741,  8.1844, -2.9224])
Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) | tensor([ 2.5107, -1.8675, -0.9786,  1.3556, -1.6568])

where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. | tensor([-1.4114, -3.3710, -1.9291,  6.5070,  0.2105])
I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. | tensor([-0.1473, -2.1458, -0.9821,  6.3290, -3.4821])
I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages... | tensor([-1.4217, -1.3239, -0.3071, -1.0942,  3.9574])

But you know what? | tensor([ 4.1398, -1.7912,  0.7584, -1.1183, -2.4270])
I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! | tensor([-1.0416, -1.2753, -2.4815,  7.9578, -3.3918])

call tech support or visit the company site to find out how. | tensor([ 4.7977, -2.6473,  0.4250, -0.2879, -2.6565])

A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about "learning" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think. | tensor([-1.4032, -4.2354,  3.6557,  0.0220,  2.6503])

  | tensor([ 3.3806, -2.9708,  1.2697,  0.5651, -2.7551])
Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language). | tensor([ 2.5397, -2.2954, -1.0313,  2.4389, -1.8181])
  | tensor([ 3.3806, -2.9708,  1.2697,  0.5651, -2.7551])
Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. | tensor([ 1.5805, -2.6663, -1.8152,  5.2488, -2.7017])
Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. | tensor([-1.5077, -2.0855, -1.7846,  8.4970, -2.9366])

A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a "pure" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned. | tensor([ 2.7938, -1.1119, -1.8645,  1.4931, -2.0672])

Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance. | tensor([ 2.7469, -2.2054, -1.0315,  2.7756, -2.5028])
