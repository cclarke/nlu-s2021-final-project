he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first. | tensor([ 8.3239, -1.9077, -2.2358, -1.2941, -1.0473, -2.2013, -2.1623, -0.2027])

The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. | tensor([ 8.6544, -2.3189, -2.2636, -2.6382, -0.2012, -2.1963, -1.1788, -0.8696])

I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. | tensor([ 8.5564, -2.0165, -2.2267, -1.4004, -0.6849, -2.7880, -1.6731, -0.4997])

The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. | tensor([ 8.6184, -1.7929, -2.4062, -2.2412, -0.5521, -1.9901, -1.5506, -0.8156])

Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?). | tensor([ 8.1710, -1.2047, -2.0762, -1.5746, -1.7605, -2.0928, -2.5637,  0.3936])
Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money. | tensor([ 7.9614, -1.7853, -2.7719, -1.9362, -1.3690, -1.4754, -1.6614,  0.6499])

Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. | tensor([ 8.4440, -2.1062, -2.5858, -2.4006, -0.0858, -1.3450, -1.6043, -1.0393])
This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. | tensor([ 6.5766, -0.9078, -1.1691, -1.0331, -3.7381, -0.5862, -1.8720,  0.8505])
And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. | tensor([ 7.8645, -1.6170, -2.3077, -2.1667,  0.2749, -1.6873, -2.5819, -0.2311])
\n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. | tensor([ 8.2071, -2.1971, -1.9782, -2.3945,  0.1255, -2.0249, -2.0920, -0.6603])
The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. | tensor([ 8.6022, -1.8101, -2.4609, -2.0121, -0.5810, -2.4187, -1.9264, -0.2349])
A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. | tensor([ 5.5482, -0.1570, -1.2516, -1.5248,  0.9991,  0.1399, -3.8504, -1.3247])
Not too skimpy on the meat. | tensor([ 8.3377, -1.9692, -2.5240, -2.6098, -0.1225, -1.1119, -1.9153, -0.8594])
I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. | tensor([ 8.5129, -2.1315, -2.0020, -2.3596, -0.4822, -1.8009, -1.9046, -0.8090])
But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. | tensor([ 7.6850, -1.6273, -2.3994, -1.6023,  0.1760, -1.2263, -1.9077, -1.4292])
Those were some big thick burgers. | tensor([ 6.9867e+00, -1.4534e-01, -2.6695e+00, -2.7047e+00,  6.3722e-01,

A steak went past for the table behind us. | tensor([ 8.2674, -2.5236, -2.0867, -2.3916, -0.1558, -1.1112, -1.5196, -1.4089])
That was HUGE! | tensor([ 8.3289, -2.1080, -2.3801, -2.8207,  0.9219, -1.8036, -2.0813, -0.5251])
And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' | tensor([ 8.1382, -1.3147, -2.4744, -2.4063, -0.7643, -0.8780, -2.4617, -0.4535])
Another table of five came in, and wham. | tensor([ 8.5362, -2.3439, -2.3133, -2.6269,  0.3953, -1.9615, -1.7238, -0.8323])
Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. | tensor([ 7.6466, -0.7802, -1.9563, -1.6647, -0.4101, -0.9042, -2.3796, -1.3223])
Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. | tensor([ 8.5049, -1.8667, -2.3540, -1.9888, -0.3749, -1.8157, -1.8328, -1.0128])
If only I could GET there on that week day before 4... | tensor([ 8.6145, -1.7730, -2.2310, -2.4342, -0.4789, -2.2734, -2.1004, -0.0277])
\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. | tensor([ 0.2275, -1.6459, -2.5244, -1.9622,  8.0661,  0.0154, -1.6781, -0.4280])
She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. | tensor([ 5.2332, -0.1919, -2.4028, -0.0109,  0.0085, -1.2901, -2.5757,  0.2187])
As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. | tensor([ 5.8901, -0.2291, -3.8562, -2.6706, -1.1540,  1.8729,  0.3879, -1.5622])
I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. | tensor([ 8.6598, -2.1671, -2.1161, -2.5986, -0.4722, -1.7007, -1.7497, -0.7610])
I am not sure that I could find it again on my own... | tensor([ 7.7306, -2.2193,  0.0918, -2.4370, -2.0832, -0.8462, -2.1122, -0.3825])
it really is a hidden gem. | tensor([ 8.3728, -2.4369, -1.7630, -2.4688, -0.4424, -1.3057, -1.8155, -0.9001])
I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. | tensor([ 8.4232, -1.9960, -1.8582, -1.7383, -1.1399, -1.2775, -1.8008, -1.0338])
A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). | tensor([ 8.3750, -2.1939, -2.2398, -2.5039, -0.3592, -1.8205, -1.8358, -0.5790])
The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. | tensor([ 8.3215, -1.3329, -2.4265, -2.9547, -0.2771, -1.4184, -2.0826, -0.3292])
This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh. | tensor([ 8.5497, -1.9306, -2.2056, -2.5073, -0.1234, -1.9252, -2.1844, -0.5495])
A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. | tensor([ 7.8986, -2.0043, -2.7250, -2.3680,  0.4303, -0.2979, -2.6361, -1.0818])
I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. | tensor([ 7.5219, -1.1198, -1.7514, -2.7106, -1.3707, -2.1811, -2.6598,  2.0282])
It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. | tensor([ 3.2394,  3.8650, -3.0942, -1.0806,  1.4253, -1.1386, -2.4503, -0.5174])
\n\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. | tensor([ 3.4957, -0.5231, -3.4579, -2.1420,  6.8735, -1.4918, -1.9217, -1.3115])
The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. | tensor([ 4.2622,  2.0127, -2.8333, -1.8312,  1.4792,  1.1198, -2.6312, -1.6511])
An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease | tensor([ 8.5557, -2.0265, -2.2913, -2.2963, -0.0195, -2.0481, -1.8291, -1.0694])
(I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. | tensor([ 8.4708, -2.0615, -2.2329, -2.3145, -0.5102, -1.9108, -1.5819, -0.5752])
I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. | tensor([ 7.8864, -1.8322, -1.8988, -0.7425, -0.7942, -2.0433, -2.1504, -0.9881])
And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. | tensor([ 8.5291, -1.9118, -2.1972, -2.0505, -0.6723, -2.5524, -1.8528, -0.0218])
The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know. | tensor([ 8.5016, -1.7163, -2.3055, -1.9566, -0.7675, -2.0212, -1.4098, -1.0905])
Good beer selection. | tensor([ 8.5676, -2.2085, -2.2554, -2.5743,  0.3112, -1.9862, -2.0146, -0.7437])
Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. | tensor([ 8.1374, -1.2135, -3.2073, -3.4215,  1.9524, -2.0744, -1.5855, -1.0723])

We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. | tensor([ 5.9379, -3.6837,  2.8640, -2.3190, -2.0701, -0.8929, -1.9634, -0.7519])
They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. | tensor([ 0.7193, -4.2178,  2.1578, -3.1394, -2.3645,  6.8227, -0.3144, -0.9922])
We will not be back . | tensor([ 8.5952, -2.3397, -1.5707, -2.7585, -0.6486, -1.3548, -1.8606, -1.0688])
The iced tea is also terrible tasting. | tensor([ 8.0437, -1.4147, -2.3871, -1.4015, -0.7837, -1.7385, -2.8847,  0.3232])
Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. | tensor([ 8.1962, -2.3818, -0.6294, -1.5831, -2.0813, -1.6326, -1.7546, -1.0026])
Try a burger on Italian bread. | tensor([-0.4061, -2.6211,  6.3930, -1.7350, -1.7224,  0.5649, -0.6457, -0.8767])
The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? | tensor([ 8.6090, -2.2817, -2.3790, -2.3408, -0.2334, -2.0088, -1.6510, -0.6787])
Oh the wings... | tensor([ 8.6061, -2.3148, -2.1973, -2.4209,  0.0130, -2.2406, -1.4997, -0.8530])

you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! | tensor([ 8.0451, -1.0372, -2.6773, -1.0980, -0.5495, -2.3339, -2.0295, -0.6559])

Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks. | tensor([ 8.5002, -1.7641, -2.5318, -2.9134, -0.0113, -1.9488, -1.6356, -0.6602])

Since they don\"t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours. | tensor([ 8.5461, -1.4936, -2.3350, -2.6594, -0.6951, -2.0590, -1.5785, -0.4431])

They lost my business for good. | tensor([ 8.5974, -2.3202, -1.9903, -2.8011, -0.4183, -1.8727, -1.3766, -0.9381])
Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. | tensor([ 8.4729, -2.5767, -1.8118, -2.4495, -0.3574, -2.0900, -1.0107, -1.1934])
Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... | tensor([ 8.6781, -1.8023, -2.2604, -2.4895, -0.4065, -2.3353, -1.8203, -0.2572])
I was originally told it would take 30 mins. | tensor([ 8.4714, -1.6798, -2.4171, -2.5808, -0.2653, -1.8982, -2.3558,  0.0764])
Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time. | tensor([ 8.6892, -2.0765, -2.3081, -2.5691, -0.2262, -1.8626, -1.6771, -0.8975])
Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. | tensor([ 8.5558, -1.4619, -2.4390, -2.7478, -0.1217, -2.1691, -2.0611, -0.3729])
I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. | tensor([ 8.6220, -2.1741, -1.9585, -2.5674, -0.6445, -1.7165, -1.7595, -0.6947])
They \"fixed\" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. | tensor([ 8.5279, -2.0633, -2.4111, -2.9312,  0.0396, -1.7688, -1.4490, -0.8013])
I called to complain, and the \"manager\" didn't even apologize!!! | tensor([ 8.4632, -2.2101, -2.3277, -2.5808, -0.1512, -2.0912, -0.9124, -1.0180])
So frustrated. | tensor([ 8.5427, -2.2762, -2.2267, -2.7022, -0.0445, -2.2005, -1.3069, -0.7606])
Never going back.   | tensor([ 8.4551, -2.4946, -1.4696, -2.8182, -0.6934, -1.2403, -1.8996, -0.6979])
They seem overpriced, too. | tensor([ 8.0209, -1.8701, -1.8184, -2.0038, -1.3805, -0.4213, -1.5259, -1.1637])
I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. | tensor([ 8.6073, -1.5552, -2.3347, -3.1389,  0.1006, -2.0267, -1.9495, -0.3731])
That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? | tensor([ 8.4851, -1.8441, -2.2134, -2.3934, -0.1353, -2.3419, -1.6879, -0.4967])
Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. | tensor([ 8.5219, -1.6086, -2.1051, -2.6399, -0.8133, -1.7110, -2.0404, -0.3128])
He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. | tensor([ 8.5580, -2.3772, -2.1899, -2.6327, -0.5384, -1.5864, -1.5651, -0.6735])
Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... | tensor([ 8.0373, -1.7187, -2.8824, -2.5958, -0.4216, -2.0972, -1.2991,  0.2841])
And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. | tensor([ 7.8068, -0.7988, -1.9528, -3.6575, -1.0412, -1.6245, -1.0655, -0.2008])
Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. | tensor([ 8.5566, -2.3350, -1.4638, -2.2703, -1.0070, -1.9220, -2.1439, -0.5033])
He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. | tensor([ 8.4047, -2.6019, -1.4000, -2.1234, -1.0598, -1.6693, -1.6599, -1.0516])
We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. | tensor([ 8.6881, -2.0636, -2.0214, -2.7467, -0.4922, -1.9107, -1.7441, -0.5822])
Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. | tensor([ 8.3639, -2.3694, -0.7896, -2.5366, -1.2867, -1.6880, -1.3462, -1.2628])
Finally I called and left messages. | tensor([ 8.6164, -2.2465, -2.3111, -2.5908,  0.0276, -2.1547, -1.8818, -0.2407])
Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. | tensor([ 8.6649, -2.1299, -2.0581, -2.3690, -0.2039, -2.4246, -1.9290, -0.3482])
He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. | tensor([ 8.5814, -1.9928, -1.6902, -1.8477, -1.5298, -1.8366, -2.0104, -0.2112])
So I hung up not knowing what was going on. | tensor([ 8.6080, -1.8859, -2.1765, -2.2406, -0.2986, -2.5324, -1.9427, -0.1999])
Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. | tensor([ 8.4602, -1.8842, -2.1248, -3.1773, -0.4701, -1.5287, -1.6138, -0.3231])
I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. | tensor([ 8.4919, -1.5909, -2.0245, -2.7224, -0.2761, -2.2489, -2.5242,  0.2687])
We finally got our survey. | tensor([ 8.0505, -2.3180, -1.3103, -3.5880, -0.9299, -0.3213, -2.0530, -0.2505])
And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. | tensor([ 8.5274, -2.1175, -2.2381, -2.6652, -0.5117, -1.8453, -1.6952, -0.5781])
I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. | tensor([ 8.6191, -2.2227, -2.1892, -2.4063, -0.3108, -2.1905, -1.4756, -0.5729])
Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. | tensor([ 8.5060, -2.4718, -2.0515, -2.3121, -0.7229, -1.7911, -1.3421, -0.7920])
I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. | tensor([ 8.3474, -2.2526, -2.1542, -2.4450, -0.8521, -1.8445, -1.5404, -0.2981])
He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. | tensor([ 8.3163, -2.1518, -2.2528, -2.4830, -0.2348, -0.9909, -2.3293, -0.4769])
\n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? | tensor([ 6.3671, -2.9869, -0.7522, -3.2917, -1.4040,  1.5980, -0.1641, -1.4940])
Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. | tensor([ 8.3938, -2.7060, -1.8128, -2.0241, -1.0347, -1.8993, -1.1196, -0.8469])
Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. | tensor([ 8.4293, -2.4879, -1.6556, -3.0809, -0.8679, -1.1133, -1.5647, -0.5738])
Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. | tensor([ 8.2932, -2.6332, -1.6135, -1.8380, -1.1025, -1.9316, -1.1994, -1.0804])
So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. | tensor([ 8.2963, -1.5764, -1.9172, -3.1166, -1.3829, -1.5466, -2.3227,  0.9947])
Where did everyone go? | tensor([ 8.2016, -1.9587, -1.4863, -2.1367, -0.9083, -2.3424, -2.3063,  0.4263])
Who knows, because I wasn't informed! | tensor([ 8.6054, -2.1170, -2.3160, -2.9055,  0.0991, -2.0907, -1.7296, -0.4148])
\n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. | tensor([ 8.6575, -2.0203, -2.1547, -2.1948, -0.3454, -2.2431, -1.8689, -0.7148])
I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. | tensor([ 8.6399, -2.1550, -2.4090, -2.3008, -0.0282, -2.2094, -1.7782, -0.7024])
He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" | tensor([ 1.1140, -1.6040,  0.7259, -3.8733, -2.4760,  6.7795, -0.9044, -0.0625])
Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. | tensor([ 8.1791, -2.1834, -2.6211, -2.8786,  1.2334, -1.2266, -1.5045, -1.7297])
The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. | tensor([ 8.4984, -1.8110, -2.3904, -2.6952,  0.0089, -1.4488, -1.9546, -0.8346])
So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. | tensor([ 8.6489, -2.2097, -2.0269, -2.5128, -0.6054, -2.2954, -1.2192, -0.6766])
\n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. | tensor([ 8.6441, -1.3817, -2.4923, -3.1113, -0.1134, -1.9871, -1.8570, -0.2598])
It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. | tensor([ 8.5580, -1.6827, -2.2490, -3.2786, -1.1015, -1.0504, -1.4600, -0.3355])
I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. | tensor([ 8.2557, -1.5250, -1.3428, -3.0544, -2.0805, -1.0439, -1.9255,  0.2761])
When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? | tensor([ 7.2951, -0.4259, -3.2341, -3.1715, -0.7184, -1.8656, -0.4718,  0.6747])
Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. | tensor([ 5.6981, -1.2896, -2.0644, -3.4575, -0.6872, -1.7036,  2.2024, -1.4885])
Why be that company? | tensor([ 8.6577, -2.5095, -1.9030, -2.7679, -0.3874, -1.8521, -1.3073, -1.1107])
Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? | tensor([ 8.3507, -2.0887, -2.3065, -2.0859, -0.6365, -1.8774, -1.1593, -1.3106])
My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. | tensor([ 8.6514, -2.2836, -1.7302, -2.5309, -0.8645, -1.5667, -1.6044, -1.0170])
Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. | tensor([ 8.6555, -1.9710, -2.1120, -2.7930, -0.6158, -2.1989, -1.5143, -0.3210])
I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. | tensor([ 8.5856, -2.0770, -2.3243, -2.3857, -0.1451, -1.9888, -1.9460, -0.5860])
It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!) | tensor([ 8.6741, -1.8795, -2.3473, -2.6437, -0.0856, -2.2238, -1.8532, -0.4193])
, I would not recommend them to anyone. | tensor([ 8.5744, -2.2978, -1.8590, -2.2811, -0.4573, -1.8383, -1.6293, -1.0750])
I heart King's. | tensor([ 8.5512, -2.4655, -2.0471, -2.5790, -0.2612, -1.9981, -1.6376, -0.6789])
I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca. | tensor([ 8.5962, -2.2614, -2.0778, -2.3311, -0.5640, -2.0530, -1.7169, -0.4923])
Average run of the mill store. | tensor([ 7.5605, -1.4447, -2.4214, -3.7983, -0.8656,  0.0644, -2.0599,  1.0520])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.   | tensor([ 7.7050, -0.1940, -2.7388, -2.2068, -1.1987, -2.8694, -1.8496,  1.3589])
Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.   | tensor([ 8.6622, -2.1616, -2.0579, -2.5689, -0.3034, -1.8976, -2.0998, -0.3645])
Found my puppy treats and moved on. | tensor([ 8.6094, -1.7399, -2.4032, -2.9111, -0.1746, -2.0338, -1.7604, -0.4617])
Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. ' | tensor([ 8.4877, -2.3491, -1.8844, -2.0281, -0.5644, -2.2166, -1.7782, -0.5189])
Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. | tensor([ 8.3794, -1.7725, -1.9995, -1.7171, -1.1327, -2.7286, -1.9647,  0.0407])
And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. | tensor([ 7.6480, -2.1514, -1.7405, -0.0742, -0.9509, -2.8753, -1.4526, -1.0416])
I ate it. | tensor([ 8.3200, -2.0185, -2.3214, -2.8675, -0.0736, -1.4957, -2.2160, -0.0494])
It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. | tensor([-1.2312, -1.4488,  7.1978, -1.9563, -2.4467, -0.2953, -0.4794, -0.1034])
Bread or not, it still wasn't great. | tensor([ 8.5077, -2.1192, -2.3086, -2.9081,  0.0565, -2.0724, -1.4287, -0.8224])
The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. | tensor([ 8.6133, -1.9932, -2.4574, -2.3876, -0.0499, -2.4862, -1.3953, -0.7952])
Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. | tensor([ 8.3702, -1.5977, -2.8723, -1.6830, -0.6293, -2.0568, -2.0141, -0.0850])
My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. | tensor([-0.0227, -1.3665,  3.1071, -1.2189,  2.3328, -2.7456, -0.6852, -0.1692])
Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. | tensor([-0.3908, -0.7529, -1.9822,  6.0706,  1.3905, -0.2822, -1.9718, -1.8763])
It was a basic salad, no big deal. | tensor([ 8.3867, -2.3035, -2.3796, -2.0105, -0.2764, -1.6079, -2.0099, -0.7426])
More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. | tensor([ 7.7395, -2.2403, -2.0396, -2.8733,  0.1695, -0.0940, -2.1065, -1.1864])
Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. | tensor([ 3.9070,  2.3225, -2.5575, -1.7860,  2.7071, -1.8493, -2.8164,  0.0722])
I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. | tensor([ 0.3588, -1.9310, -0.6787, -2.5263, -2.1880,  8.5545, -0.7563, -0.9770])
I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. | tensor([ 8.5691, -2.1980, -2.2196, -2.2075, -0.1357, -2.2773, -1.8468, -0.4764])
It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. | tensor([ 0.4534, -1.4136, -2.4785, -2.7458,  6.5608,  2.3164, -2.3385,  0.2335])
The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. | tensor([ 7.7818, -2.5089, -1.5820, -2.4614, -1.3829,  0.2502, -1.5779, -1.2947])
\n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. | tensor([ 6.0102,  0.5928, -2.7992, -2.1212,  0.4391, -0.1770, -2.3515, -0.7457])
They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. | tensor([ 7.2664, -1.3091, -2.8498, -2.3298, -1.3584,  1.5805, -1.6157, -1.0598])
Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? | tensor([ 8.4890, -2.1848, -2.2231, -2.6444, -0.0470, -1.7233, -1.5352, -0.9716])
Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. | tensor([ 8.4996, -1.7315, -1.8649, -1.7834, -1.3086, -2.0782, -2.0616, -0.3525])
Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. | tensor([ 2.1522, -2.5720, -1.2660, -2.5783, -2.7990,  7.8171, -0.3868, -0.6611])
Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. | tensor([ 4.9929,  0.2438, -2.5352,  3.3497, -1.7600, -2.1779, -2.0114, -0.9846])
But apparently, mama has left the kitchen. | tensor([ 1.0857, -1.7777, -2.3440, -2.3425,  8.4765, -0.9293, -2.0306, -0.2180])
Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong. | tensor([ 8.5473, -1.9602, -2.2378, -2.4713, -0.3057, -1.9222, -2.1085, -0.4446])

Their food is good. | tensor([ 7.2910, -2.7954,  0.6494, -3.3036, -1.7609,  0.7518, -1.8648, -1.5919])
 Not haute cuisine, pretentious!   | tensor([ 8.0734, -2.4530, -1.5402, -2.4756,  0.3195, -1.9494, -1.2569, -1.8901])
Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking. | tensor([ 6.2527,  0.4541, -3.3411, -1.8733,  1.2095, -1.5625, -3.2095,  0.8295])

I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \"linner\" in the bar.\nHe ordered the large version of fish sandwich.   | tensor([ 8.0692, -0.9591, -2.7120, -2.3483, -0.8789, -0.7451, -2.2971, -0.4209])
Rocky's is famous for their fish. | tensor([ 7.6682, -0.2838, -1.0522, -2.4411, -1.9565, -1.2654, -2.8555,  0.6427])

Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.   | tensor([ 5.3534,  0.3552, -2.1689, -1.5703,  1.2188, -0.6445, -2.7239, -0.7030])
Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.\nI ordered the meatball grill. | tensor([ 8.2539, -1.8423, -2.6244, -2.5008, -0.4247, -1.2198, -1.7553, -0.5952])

It was delish. | tensor([ 8.4008, -2.3656, -2.2544, -1.7766, -0.0805, -2.4004, -1.6333, -0.6986])

Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \"grilled cheese\" (mozzarella) style. | tensor([ 8.0677, -2.2566, -1.8864, -1.8031, -0.2547, -1.0501, -2.0614, -1.2754])

The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. | tensor([ 8.4841, -2.1246, -1.4571, -2.9520, -0.8387, -2.4936, -2.0804,  0.5020])

Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. | tensor([ 8.5753, -2.0461, -2.2026, -1.8102, -0.4800, -2.2324, -1.9900, -0.5936])
I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00. | tensor([ 8.6477, -1.9601, -2.2275, -2.2842, -0.3906, -2.1426, -1.5316, -0.8886])

Same overtime. | tensor([ 8.5975, -2.4113, -2.0057, -3.0820,  0.3445, -1.7494, -1.6972, -0.9363])

My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\n\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. | tensor([ 5.9764, -0.1426, -2.5373, -0.9658, -0.4961, -1.0836, -3.3737,  0.7640])
I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. | tensor([ 7.7359, -1.8818, -2.5944, -2.9977,  0.8303, -0.9895, -2.6509, -0.0227])
The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. | tensor([ 7.7683, -1.4572, -2.6548, -2.9006,  0.2323, -1.2959, -1.9831, -0.3416])

The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. | tensor([ 8.6507, -2.0888, -2.1922, -2.3959, -0.3475, -2.2016, -1.8189, -0.5256])
I would give the food 3/5.\n\nThe service was subpar for sure. | tensor([ 1.4285, -2.8405,  3.5171, -1.2261, -1.8835, -0.3401,  0.6669, -0.8651])
While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. | tensor([ 1.3710,  0.2107, -2.9206, -2.4767,  7.9602, -1.5512, -1.7479, -0.3399])
Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. | tensor([ 5.8726, -2.4095, -2.2956, -1.1848,  1.8341, -1.1985, -1.8233, -0.4489])
She got the order messed up and so on. | tensor([ 8.5583, -2.1720, -2.4650, -2.9009,  0.3812, -2.0093, -1.6976, -0.4956])
I give the service 2/5.\n\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. | tensor([ 8.5315, -2.3728, -2.1369, -2.5228, -0.6033, -1.4352, -1.5814, -0.7255])
It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. | tensor([ 6.2976, -2.1506,  0.1273, -2.7365, -1.7404, -0.5556, -1.7954,  0.3814])
A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. | tensor([ 5.7634, -1.3896, -1.8319, -2.0595, -0.4458, -0.9890, -0.6476, -0.6118])
I give the interior 2/5.\n\nThe prices were decent. | tensor([ 7.2070, -2.0989, -2.3213, -3.7849, -0.5397,  0.8340, -1.6461, -0.0842])
I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. | tensor([ 7.3055, -0.5138, -1.9916, -3.2640, -1.0569, -2.3232, -2.0988,  1.8667])
I give the prices 3/5.\n\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. | tensor([ 8.3300, -1.9455, -1.2758, -1.7044, -1.5724, -1.8095, -2.0353, -0.9120])
There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's. | tensor([ 8.5906, -2.3254, -2.3338, -2.2207, -0.0135, -2.1936, -1.7560, -0.7739])
My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. | tensor([ 5.7441, -2.6155,  1.0710, -2.6364, -2.0332,  1.1103, -2.2958, -0.3493])
It was easy to find and no problems with parking. | tensor([ 8.0720, -1.7074, -2.1471, -2.1133, -1.2704, -0.6974, -2.1541, -0.4662])
It's \"Seat Yourself\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. | tensor([ 8.4341, -2.0077, -2.0205, -2.1902, -0.6922, -2.0138, -1.1927, -1.1848])
It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. | tensor([ 7.5160, -1.8003, -2.6718, -3.2182,  2.4771, -2.4555, -1.9829, -0.1269])
She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. | tensor([ 8.5321, -2.3869, -2.2927, -3.1078,  0.1398, -1.8815, -1.0110, -0.8527])
No big deal and her apology was appreciated. | tensor([ 8.6428, -2.0498, -2.3728, -2.7171,  0.1962, -2.2235, -1.7525, -0.6104])
She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. | tensor([ 5.9915, -1.9405, -2.0025, -3.1025,  1.5465, -2.3997, -1.1643,  0.3152])
We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. | tensor([ 8.5100, -1.5805, -2.3921, -2.9371,  0.0181, -2.1583, -2.0317,  0.0677])
Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. | tensor([ 8.3512, -1.7234, -2.6297, -3.1060,  0.9214, -2.3541, -1.9305, -0.0487])
This was aggravating to me. | tensor([ 8.5222, -2.1643, -2.1739, -2.3400, -0.3252, -1.9987, -1.8937, -0.4840])
I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome | tensor([ 7.9016, -0.6831, -1.6989, -1.6200, -0.9660, -1.8382, -3.2176, -0.0173])
and they're making it with love, but come on now. | tensor([ 8.5395, -2.1266, -2.0721, -2.5674, -0.1459, -1.5784, -2.2328, -0.5594])
We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. | tensor([ 8.2346, -2.0612, -2.3514, -2.7094,  0.3673, -1.5338, -2.1909, -0.8138])
The food was alright, really nothing special. | tensor([ 8.5359, -2.1541, -1.4411, -1.8266, -1.0078, -1.7909, -2.3572, -0.8390])
A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. | tensor([ 0.2280, -1.3770, -1.7929, -1.5622,  7.6360, -1.1862, -2.0444, -0.1864])
We may or may not go back. | tensor([ 8.6131, -2.1926, -1.4758, -2.6641, -1.0260, -1.6278, -1.7176, -0.9296])

If I could give this place less than one star, I would. | tensor([ 8.6585, -1.7244, -2.0166, -2.5690, -0.7471, -1.6859, -2.0050, -0.6419])
I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. | tensor([ 8.4676, -1.6886, -2.0210, -1.4068, -1.2561, -1.9658, -2.1123, -0.6711])
The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. | tensor([ 8.6436, -2.1857, -2.5406, -2.3252, -0.3109, -1.9375, -1.2302, -1.0767])
We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. | tensor([-0.9761, -2.4486,  7.5238, -2.5754, -1.9922,  0.2424, -2.3093,  1.1140])

I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. | tensor([ 8.1566, -1.1939, -2.3055, -2.0415, -0.8259, -2.1932, -2.3594,  0.1109])
He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". | tensor([ 8.2427, -1.6435, -1.2862, -2.6575, -1.1925, -0.7800, -1.9759, -1.1697])
No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. | tensor([ 3.3582, -2.9194,  1.2642, -0.9718, -0.7745, -1.5776,  1.7234, -2.3226])
So, we gamely tried to order other things. | tensor([ 8.6103, -2.3548, -1.9201, -2.5486, -0.4272, -1.4888, -1.6039, -1.1340])
We placed our order. | tensor([ 8.5471, -2.6424, -1.9154, -2.7694, -0.0708, -1.9969, -1.1189, -1.2162])
My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. | tensor([ 8.5102, -2.4527, -1.8190, -2.7198, -0.6606, -1.8214, -1.3339, -0.8777])
At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". | tensor([ 8.4700, -1.6160, -2.1672, -2.5379, -0.1387, -2.5441, -1.8748, -0.5443])
At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. | tensor([ 8.3992, -2.3309, -1.3958, -2.2211, -0.9964, -1.9402, -1.3794, -1.1146])
They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. | tensor([ 8.2279, -1.5864, -2.2824, -2.0912, -1.3520, -1.8502, -1.7254, -0.0870])
In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. | tensor([ 7.9520, -1.4441, -2.7034, -0.3944, -0.9047, -2.8532, -1.9865, -0.4446])
Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. | tensor([ 7.8360, -2.8193, -1.7511,  0.1648, -1.5049, -2.1998, -0.7466, -1.9049])
I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once. | tensor([ 0.1354, -1.0912, -2.1181,  8.5151, -1.0721, -2.1358, -1.5063, -1.0040])

The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.   | tensor([ 7.8223, -2.4529, -2.0634, -0.9483, -0.4812, -2.5617, -0.8877, -1.7159])
But, that's not what this place is about. | tensor([ 8.6367, -2.2426, -1.9939, -2.3755, -0.2197, -2.2585, -1.6888, -0.8149])

It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals. | tensor([ 6.0498, -3.4196,  1.7721, -2.2036, -1.6958, -0.3757, -2.0282, -1.1350])

Still with me?\n\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. | tensor([ 5.9692, -2.3131,  0.8737, -2.0222, -2.0230, -0.8742, -3.0714,  0.9442])

\n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. | tensor([ 5.1638, -2.3736, -3.0693,  0.4657,  0.9412, -1.9221, -0.1073, -1.3724])

\n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. | tensor([ 8.6594, -2.1262, -2.0498, -2.4156, -0.5941, -2.3452, -1.5726, -0.5309])
While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. | tensor([ 7.5345, -3.1086, -1.4253, -2.3045, -0.7917, -1.1203, -0.0845, -1.6845])

There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. | tensor([ 7.0787,  0.8186, -2.2771, -2.8424, -1.9154, -2.3603, -2.0454,  2.1779])

Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. | tensor([-1.4131,  1.7419, -0.1473,  3.4687,  1.3380, -2.2576, -0.8599, -0.9363])

I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. | tensor([ 2.4924,  4.1133, -3.8771,  1.6649, -1.3516, -2.6762, -0.8835,  0.9963])
I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. | tensor([ 3.9135,  2.4346, -2.9964,  0.9073, -1.0629, -3.1098, -2.6451,  2.6537])
The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. | tensor([ 0.7660,  0.5131, -3.0440, -1.9063,  8.4673, -1.4810, -1.6329, -0.6562])

I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. | tensor([ 8.2788, -0.7979, -2.7428, -2.6481,  0.1794, -2.2551, -1.5714, -0.7345])

My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\n\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. | tensor([-0.4912, -2.9232,  2.4681, -1.7656, -1.9400,  6.8400, -1.9231, -0.8177])
The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\n\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. | tensor([ 8.2064, -2.3169, -2.1664, -2.2887, -1.3723, -0.3083, -1.6279, -0.6104])
\n\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- | tensor([ 8.1206, -1.1539, -2.2417, -2.3544, -1.2875, -2.3778, -2.2024,  0.8184])

Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. | tensor([ 8.3592, -1.4209, -2.2528, -1.9998, -0.8700, -2.6313, -2.3766,  0.4211])
Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm | tensor([ 4.5190,  2.6721, -2.6697,  1.4236, -2.0184, -3.0845, -1.8185,  0.6711])

The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. | tensor([ 8.3707, -1.9807, -2.4935, -2.6393,  0.1815, -1.9480, -2.1672, -0.1519])

it was perfect. | tensor([ 8.4032, -2.2505, -2.0467, -2.8962, -0.0591, -1.2080, -2.3142, -0.3601])
My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. | tensor([ 8.3284, -1.8012, -2.8215, -1.8861, -0.4114, -1.7427, -1.8399, -0.6103])

In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\n\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh | tensor([-0.6522, -3.0790,  3.0503, -2.5736, -2.8155,  7.4017, -1.2800, -0.5221])
but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :) | tensor([ 8.3736, -1.5624, -2.0546, -2.2123, -1.0340, -2.0762, -2.6036,  0.5369])

experiences.\n\nBoth times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\n\nFor entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience. | tensor([ 7.5864, -1.7521, -2.5329, -1.2976, -0.5838, -1.7215, -1.9416, -0.4452])

My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. | tensor([ 7.2088, -2.4922,  0.8552, -1.7546, -1.8036, -2.1829, -2.1311, -0.8423])
\n\nThe service is also a mixed bag. | tensor([ 6.6000, -3.1844, -1.8256, -1.7554, -0.8666, -0.7771, -0.9211, -0.4846])

The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich. | tensor([ 7.4181, -1.8486, -3.0087, -1.9335,  2.7674, -2.4768, -1.9429, -1.3794])

The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us. | tensor([ 8.4022, -2.0864, -2.5695, -1.2792, -0.5654, -2.4139, -1.2980, -1.0691])

\n\nI would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson. | tensor([ 8.5008, -1.7579, -2.2398, -2.5388, -0.9835, -1.7581, -2.1969,  0.4216])
What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 8.4828, -1.8103, -2.2090, -2.5174, -0.6435, -1.8713, -2.2171,  0.1831])

I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.   | tensor([ 8.6281, -1.9716, -2.3676, -2.3280, -0.4680, -2.0996, -1.5515, -0.5305])
They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside. | tensor([-0.9863, -2.8502,  1.4210, -2.1266,  4.6353,  0.4012, -2.2416,  0.4490])

You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated. | tensor([ 3.5564, -1.6050, -2.0885, -1.3330,  4.6086, -0.8617, -2.4084, -0.6061])
 \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked. | tensor([ 8.5264, -2.3278, -2.1104, -1.5017, -0.7340, -2.4577, -1.3609, -0.9239])

The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.   | tensor([ 8.1434, -2.2450, -1.6672, -1.9053, -0.9461, -1.9504, -1.8796, -0.4687])
They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.   | tensor([ 8.7131, -1.7737, -1.6426, -2.4032, -0.8764, -1.4943, -2.1733, -0.9198])
Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.   | tensor([ 2.0070, -3.2077,  3.1718, -3.5854,  0.4625, -0.1305, -1.4239, -0.0045])
Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.   | tensor([ 8.5028, -2.2124, -2.2320, -2.4366, -0.5032, -1.8546, -1.7866, -0.2710])
Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it. | tensor([ 8.5111, -2.2490, -1.7886, -2.0994, -0.9787, -1.7251, -1.9762, -0.4470])
 \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for. | tensor([ 8.1895, -2.0041, -0.9918, -2.1559, -0.9338, -1.8920, -2.0755, -1.1401])

Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves. | tensor([ 6.7919,  0.4368, -1.1760, -1.7411, -2.3984, -0.1326, -1.8188, -1.3559])

One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.   | tensor([ 8.2083, -1.2291, -2.5600, -2.1811, -0.2689, -1.6392, -2.3602, -0.8348])
As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better. | tensor([ 6.8408, -0.1132, -1.5363, -0.7124, -0.6182, -2.1398, -1.5325, -1.5652])
 \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.   | tensor([ 7.5791, -0.1131, -1.5897, -1.5397, -2.2729, -1.8178, -1.6229, -0.5217])

\n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well. | tensor([ 7.3583, -2.2907, -1.4593, -0.5413, -2.3314, -0.0899, -2.0225, -0.5850])

I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable. | tensor([ 4.8877, -2.7741, -1.6815, -2.6210, -1.3900,  4.6777, -1.6744, -1.6286])

Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.   | tensor([ 7.8336, -2.3481, -2.3498, -3.1419, -0.5206,  1.1372, -1.9742, -1.0536])

Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\n\nLike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting. | tensor([ 8.2587, -2.5938, -1.7816, -1.3235, -0.8154, -1.9541, -1.4319, -0.8784])

 \n\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\n\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies. | tensor([ 4.9332, -2.4786, -1.7443, -2.5140, -0.6418,  4.5008, -1.2482, -2.1169])

In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. | tensor([ 0.9631, -3.0329,  4.5817, -1.1578, -0.8759, -0.0713, -0.8280, -1.6698])

The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta. | tensor([ 6.7127, -2.4108, -1.9425, -1.7007,  0.8655, -0.2329, -2.5930, -0.6710])

The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. | tensor([ 5.9836, -3.1129,  2.5303, -3.1821, -1.8878, -0.3012, -2.1898, -1.0245])

I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. | tensor([ 8.1942, -1.6309, -2.5251, -2.8703, -0.1406, -0.8691, -2.4860, -0.2495])
But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. | tensor([ 8.5424, -1.8970, -2.6556, -2.0726,  0.1764, -2.3769, -1.2590, -1.2778])
As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. | tensor([ 7.9699, -1.6816, -2.8437, -3.1202,  0.4590, -0.6906, -2.1839, -0.5917])
I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. | tensor([ 8.6436, -1.8554, -2.4064, -2.3020, -0.1273, -2.2146, -1.8723, -0.5358])
It was one thing after another with our server. | tensor([ 8.6464, -2.3199, -2.2873, -2.7459, -0.0906, -2.1029, -1.3768, -0.6982])
My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point). | tensor([ 6.4432, -0.6693, -3.1960, -3.7276,  3.4907, -1.8887, -2.6018,  0.7140])

I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? | tensor([ 7.0443, -0.7653, -2.2118, -1.6819,  0.5363, -1.9043, -2.3918, -0.5333])
There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. | tensor([ 8.3053, -2.0015, -2.5060, -2.6464, -0.4115, -2.2245, -1.6594,  0.2152])
My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). | tensor([ 6.1895, -0.2399, -2.7233, -1.4459, -0.3985, -0.1049, -2.4543, -0.5276])
Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. | tensor([ 8.2808, -1.5624, -2.4600, -2.7746,  0.2564, -1.9656, -2.0355, -0.4853])
Not what the special was at all.   | tensor([ 1.2082, -1.4962, -2.3514,  7.6724, -0.5188, -1.8830, -2.2536, -1.1197])
And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. | tensor([ 8.6840, -2.3768, -2.4609, -2.5534,  0.4646, -2.3453, -1.3499, -0.9473])
Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. | tensor([ 8.5909, -2.3684, -2.0918, -2.5275, -0.2771, -2.1641, -1.2494, -1.0653])
\n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. | tensor([ 8.6307, -2.1280, -2.3733, -2.2250, -0.1117, -2.4578, -1.2545, -0.9700])
When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. | tensor([ 7.8189, -1.5895, -2.4585, -2.4709,  1.1761, -2.6361, -0.4731, -1.7617])
At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) | tensor([ 8.6411, -2.0316, -2.2346, -1.9624, -0.4203, -2.4913, -1.6086, -0.7974])
so the trout was basically cold. | tensor([ 8.5201, -1.0143, -2.2551, -3.0149, -0.8651, -1.6884, -1.8593, -0.2978])
The server then said he would have the meals re-made. | tensor([ 4.8334, -2.4408, -1.3230, -0.2289,  2.1951, -1.7175, -1.6425, -1.8503])
So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. | tensor([ 0.7698, -2.4969, -1.9995, -1.6864,  7.7759, -0.9021, -1.9174, -0.4716])
Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. | tensor([ 1.0821, -1.5312, -2.0207, -2.4641,  7.5807, -1.0366, -2.6770,  0.8396])
Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). | tensor([ 1.0029, -1.1186, -2.2908, -1.9726,  8.0326, -1.4765, -2.6954,  0.7772])
All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! | tensor([-1.5109, -0.0704, -2.1079, -1.5732,  6.7497, -1.9842,  1.7323, -0.7770])
They didn't remake anything. | tensor([ 8.4071, -2.1323, -1.9081, -1.9594, -1.4258, -1.8386, -1.3351, -0.3514])
Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. | tensor([ 7.2549, -1.3615, -0.3577, -2.0749, -1.3267, -1.1206, -2.7397, -0.5362])
Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. | tensor([ 8.5188, -1.5770, -2.4359, -2.5530, -0.4610, -1.8675, -1.8545, -0.5155])

After they gave me novocaine they get me with \"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\". | tensor([ 8.2266, -2.1051, -2.2000, -2.4371, -0.2393, -1.4996, -2.0604, -0.2594])
I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. | tensor([ 8.5904, -1.6865, -2.2059, -2.4986, -0.4581, -2.3278, -2.1339,  0.0155])
I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. | tensor([ 8.5419, -1.7193, -2.5201, -2.7197,  0.0357, -2.0829, -1.8476, -0.4052])

I had to pay $259.00 for this \"bone graft\". | tensor([ 8.2771, -1.8731, -2.3176, -2.7444, -0.2871, -1.6964, -1.9502, -0.1424])
So, I signed everything. | tensor([ 8.5625, -2.1129, -2.4586, -2.7656,  0.0311, -2.0222, -1.6646, -0.4421])
I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. | tensor([ 8.5752, -1.9497, -2.3911, -2.0276, -0.4658, -2.2968, -1.8619, -0.2598])
The \"dentist\" started the extraction. | tensor([ 8.1743, -2.0252, -2.2708, -2.9257, -0.2445, -1.4529, -1.9377, -0.0221])

He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.   | tensor([ 8.1478, -1.9788, -2.3390, -1.2706, -0.6276, -1.5242, -2.4898, -0.1873])
Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. | tensor([ 8.1106, -1.5446, -2.5081, -2.5490, -0.5369, -1.9387, -2.4700,  1.2106])
I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. | tensor([ 8.4851, -1.3334, -2.5143, -2.7054, -0.6183, -1.9738, -1.7517,  0.2778])
He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. | tensor([ 7.2802, -1.4721, -2.0176, -4.0937, -0.7530,  0.0226, -1.8073,  0.6225])
I'm assuming this was the bone graft. | tensor([ 8.4274, -2.0428, -2.1748, -2.9988,  0.1574, -2.1738, -1.7711, -0.1550])

I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. | tensor([ 8.4702, -2.4703, -1.6305, -2.6331, -0.8198, -1.8588, -1.6847, -0.1815])
Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! | tensor([ 8.2221, -2.5283, -1.8941, -2.5133,  0.0158, -1.9017, -1.8291, -0.2308])
My insurance covers 100% of extractions. | tensor([ 8.4313, -1.9654, -1.9777, -2.9557, -0.6936, -1.8891, -1.9626, -0.0322])

I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. | tensor([ 8.0404, -1.0207, -2.5424, -2.8267, -0.4621, -2.3175, -2.3429,  1.3102])
Pain severe enough that I had to call off work | tensor([ 8.6069, -1.9171, -2.4789, -1.9922, -0.3042, -2.6266, -1.9265, -0.0839])

I refused to go back to Emmert Dental. | tensor([ 8.5169, -2.0287, -2.4090, -2.2274, -0.1278, -2.2342, -1.5491, -0.6089])

And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.   | tensor([ 8.4476, -1.5289, -2.8515, -1.7036, -0.1508, -2.4264, -1.5102, -0.6949])
They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth. | tensor([ 8.5090, -1.4944, -2.4723, -2.4229, -0.1489, -1.9910, -2.1218, -0.2347])

Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work. | tensor([ 8.4149, -2.0114, -2.4909, -1.6664, -0.1117, -2.6244, -1.2714, -1.0875])

They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. | tensor([ 8.1399, -2.3676, -1.3362, -1.5290, -1.3069, -1.5055, -1.1043, -1.7694])
And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily. | tensor([ 8.5317, -2.4992, -2.1017, -2.3503, -0.2488, -2.2234, -1.0075, -1.3246])

They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant. | tensor([ 8.2878, -2.3126, -2.1506, -2.3942, -0.3978, -1.6988, -1.8553, -0.3962])

And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals. | tensor([ 8.2499, -1.7327, -2.5663, -1.3926, -0.4915, -2.4813, -1.8031, -0.3925])

The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. | tensor([ 8.5571, -1.8215, -2.4399, -1.9016, -0.5976, -2.5876, -1.0911, -0.9977])

The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n\nThen again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO. | tensor([ 8.5302, -2.5768, -1.7545, -2.8570, -0.9327, -1.4948, -0.7742, -1.2698])

I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. | tensor([ 8.1557, -0.5037, -2.4460, -2.7674, -0.6574, -2.5756, -2.2315,  0.4419])
After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. | tensor([ 8.4157, -2.6770, -2.0989, -1.4617, -0.5355, -2.2973, -1.3493, -1.0173])

But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. | tensor([ 8.3225, -2.2737, -2.2532, -2.0767, -0.4918, -2.2371, -0.6364, -1.2799])
She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. | tensor([ 8.4955, -1.1200, -2.8306, -2.3786,  0.1097, -2.5213, -1.9290, -0.3822])

The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. | tensor([ 8.6672, -1.7191, -2.5973, -2.4330, -0.4066, -1.8629, -1.9430, -0.3713])

Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. | tensor([ 8.4180, -1.8337, -2.2444, -2.4939, -0.5581, -1.4228, -1.6466, -0.6229])

I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. | tensor([ 6.8750, -0.3675, -2.7678,  1.1119, -1.7784, -2.1219, -2.4864, -0.2177])

The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. | tensor([ 7.9287, -2.7343, -1.7279, -2.3935, -0.8071, -1.6427, -0.1502, -1.1424])
From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. | tensor([ 7.2432, -2.6043, -1.6348, -1.9835, -1.2797, -1.2991,  0.6194, -1.8844])
Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient.... | tensor([ 8.6314, -2.1062, -2.4028, -1.8488, -0.2967, -2.0846, -1.5017, -1.2896])
The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. | tensor([ 8.3038, -1.3949, -2.5128, -2.2239, -0.3576, -2.3383, -2.3023,  0.3256])

The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. | tensor([ 8.5083, -1.7953, -2.3852, -2.0274, -0.4150, -1.8087, -1.9706, -0.7409])
They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. | tensor([ 7.9698, -1.4276, -2.0869, -1.3940, -0.9020, -1.4382, -2.3321, -0.7625])

It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. | tensor([ 8.4710, -2.0248, -2.4230, -2.8568, -0.1181, -1.4278, -1.7269, -0.6884])
It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. | tensor([ 8.4883, -2.2956, -2.0437, -2.2320, -0.8780, -1.8713, -1.4985, -0.4566])

I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \n\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. | tensor([ 7.8031, -0.9393, -2.6887, -2.5140, -1.1721, -1.4605, -2.1735,  0.8274])

It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. | tensor([ 8.5669, -2.0654, -2.3828, -2.4382, -0.3013, -2.3387, -1.4407, -0.5749])
The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think | tensor([ 8.5465, -2.1509, -2.2899, -2.1920, -0.2880, -1.8635, -1.6329, -1.0711])

Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\n\nLong story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. | tensor([ 0.5369, -1.4579, -1.8776, -1.4016,  8.1601, -1.9293, -1.8095, -0.2716])

It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.

The \"steakburger\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it. | tensor([ 5.8216, -0.6214, -2.3535, -0.1031, -0.4892, -0.6817, -0.9906, -1.7083])

It was all I could taste.\n\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again. | tensor([ 8.6062, -2.1374, -2.4967, -2.4633,  0.3933, -2.3702, -1.7837, -0.5704])

It's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am. | tensor([ 8.0012, -1.3522, -1.8454, -0.8095, -1.8371, -1.8321, -2.2634, -0.2521])
You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. | tensor([ 8.1145, -0.3889, -3.1210, -2.4017, -0.4411, -2.7239, -1.2090, -0.0430])

I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. | tensor([ 8.6338, -1.7834, -2.5290, -2.5408,  0.0390, -2.4600, -1.4954, -0.5334])

Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like | tensor([ 8.4537e+00, -1.8058e+00, -2.5318e+00, -2.4828e+00,  4.7726e-03,

There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. | tensor([ 8.4955, -1.8247, -2.2469, -1.7471, -0.8618, -2.0584, -1.9672, -0.3152])

As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\r\n\r\nAs a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. | tensor([ 8.3840, -2.0853, -2.5133, -1.6084, -0.6231, -2.4713, -1.5219, -0.3148])

It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\r\n\r\nAs far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. | tensor([ 7.9739, -1.3635, -2.8657, -2.2251,  0.4996, -2.3731, -1.7045, -0.6041])

Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here. | tensor([ 7.7947e+00, -1.9830e+00, -1.2998e+00, -2.9046e+00, -1.7523e+00,

Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \"Paradise City\" with the rest of the crowd. | tensor([ 6.2459, -1.2419, -3.2527,  0.9661, -1.3944, -2.5841, -2.4015,  2.1613])

It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. | tensor([ 7.2115, -2.3192, -2.2285, -1.4743, -1.1461, -1.1494, -1.3214,  0.3896])

I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. | tensor([ 8.5773, -2.0001, -2.3876, -1.7686, -0.4251, -2.4091, -2.0754, -0.2812])
But again, that's just me.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve. | tensor([ 5.9733, -3.8013, -1.0938, -1.8057,  0.2088, -0.1328, -0.9628, -0.8056])

Then when the chain restaurant magnet \"waterfront\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\n\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. | tensor([ 3.8272, -1.4844, -0.6875, -3.1539, -2.8927,  2.6658, -1.9420,  2.4471])

From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. | tensor([ 8.4149, -2.0429, -2.0766, -1.3132, -0.9969, -2.5318, -1.7614, -0.4425])
Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\n\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. | tensor([ 8.1592, -0.8095, -2.5449, -2.0680, -1.4918, -1.7181, -1.8210, -0.0940])

Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! | tensor([ 8.1734, -2.1467, -2.5857, -0.6351, -0.5733, -2.7505, -1.9819, -0.1009])

Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all. | tensor([ 8.2988, -2.0762, -2.5907, -0.9140, -0.5712, -2.4312, -1.4419, -0.9904])

It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be. | tensor([ 8.4654, -1.9091, -1.8255, -1.8815, -1.7229, -1.6123, -1.5986, -0.4050])

It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \n\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. | tensor([ 4.9473, -1.2245, -3.2504,  1.9030,  0.9865, -2.5938, -2.9249,  1.0600])

The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \"you bitch, you slut, you whore\" and  \"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... | tensor([ 6.0209, -2.4990, -3.1481, -0.6082,  3.2892, -2.8338, -1.0040, -1.0417])

He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls. | tensor([ 7.6040, -1.4530, -2.5239, -0.0478, -1.2566, -2.6619, -2.7624,  1.1571])
Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. | tensor([ 8.5700, -1.8731, -1.9141, -2.0996, -1.0072, -2.0450, -2.1826, -0.2783])
The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again. | tensor([ 8.5557, -1.6553, -2.4670, -1.9800, -0.9250, -2.1334, -1.8078, -0.1267])

The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. | tensor([ 8.3351, -2.2875, -2.4292, -1.3294, -0.6430, -2.4056, -1.9524,  0.1181])

When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \"Rock Bottom\" restaurant for some grub. | tensor([ 8.2452, -1.7501, -2.2159, -1.6655, -1.2696, -2.5682, -1.9267,  0.3837])
We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.\n\nThere were some drawbacks though. | tensor([ 8.4865, -1.4419, -2.4028, -2.4407, -0.7354, -1.8974, -2.2044,  0.0720])
We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. | tensor([ 8.6756, -1.8099, -2.1244, -2.7033, -0.4145, -1.8586, -2.2488, -0.1885])

But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. | tensor([ 8.5043, -1.9839, -1.5895, -2.4380, -1.6460, -1.9906, -1.7343, -0.0268])

I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. | tensor([ 8.6377, -1.8234, -2.3007, -2.0215, -0.6664, -2.2827, -2.0121, -0.3597])
I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \"oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\". | tensor([ 8.3368, -1.7542, -2.2586, -1.4596, -0.7885, -2.5403, -2.2215,  0.1178])

\n\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. | tensor([ 8.5245, -1.8979, -2.3518, -2.7321, -0.0891, -2.3325, -1.7286, -0.0842])
Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \"oh, and we don't take checks\". | tensor([ 8.2541, -2.4065, -1.8433, -1.5184, -0.8764, -1.7139, -1.6747, -0.7604])
\n\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \"yes, of course\". | tensor([ 7.3500, -1.0565, -2.4438, -1.0980, -0.1930, -3.2808, -2.9050,  1.0364])

When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. | tensor([ 8.6878, -2.1673, -2.0052, -2.0887, -0.8307, -1.9996, -1.8380, -0.6410])

Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. | tensor([ 8.6988, -1.8869, -2.3377, -2.3126, -0.3857, -2.5213, -1.8136, -0.2863])
As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times. | tensor([ 8.6851, -2.2124, -2.1893, -2.1253, -0.4741, -2.2688, -1.7816, -0.6569])

Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden. | tensor([ 8.0520, -1.5476, -2.3827, -2.3829, -1.3254, -1.8663, -1.9172,  1.1150])

Hate to admit it, but it's true. | tensor([ 8.6331, -2.1526, -1.9493, -2.9006, -0.7388, -1.3753, -1.8342, -0.6366])
The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. | tensor([ 4.5511,  0.3549, -3.6657, -0.8596,  1.9387, -1.0327, -2.2045, -0.6353])
I get it way too much. | tensor([ 8.6167, -2.3371, -2.3358, -2.6426,  0.0130, -1.7435, -1.6935, -0.8905])
People make fun of me.\n\nThey have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi. | tensor([ 8.4025, -1.7601, -2.1741, -2.4710, -0.6103, -1.8866, -1.6850, -0.7087])
This place is overrated. | tensor([ 8.5721, -2.4159, -1.7224, -2.1809, -0.7480, -2.0333, -1.8175, -0.4853])
A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- | tensor([ 8.5298, -2.3496, -2.0323, -2.1503, -0.2643, -1.7963, -2.1397, -0.6081])
instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. | tensor([ 8.3205, -1.8604, -2.7064, -0.9573, -0.8847, -2.4755, -1.4998, -0.4928])
There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. | tensor([ 8.6655, -2.0774, -2.1999, -2.3959, -0.5195, -1.9070, -1.6481, -0.8875])
There should be no clout. | tensor([ 8.3449, -2.6427, -2.0997, -2.6418, -0.5712, -1.3242, -0.4658, -1.7769])
There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.   | tensor([ 8.1684, -1.5427, -1.4224, -1.1452, -1.7822, -1.7324, -1.9715, -1.0027])
We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms. | tensor([ 8.3147, -1.5701, -2.7084, -2.4253,  0.0314, -2.5985, -2.1230,  0.6437])

Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that. | tensor([ 8.0568, -2.0340, -0.7282, -2.6498, -2.0721, -0.9725, -1.3012, -1.1785])

Our orders were somewhat mixed up. | tensor([ 8.6863, -2.3617, -1.9017, -2.7282, -0.6668, -1.7432, -1.5199, -0.8039])

The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing. | tensor([ 8.1203, -1.2752, -2.0809, -1.8078, -0.6584, -1.3468, -2.0246, -1.3627])

I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer. | tensor([ 8.3922, -2.2088, -1.7928, -2.2172, -0.8449, -1.8191, -1.9727, -0.4806])

The crust was delicious and homemade. | tensor([ 3.7932,  1.1177, -1.0606, -2.1473,  1.9769, -0.5397, -1.4991, -2.0851])

If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza. | tensor([ 8.4925, -1.6330, -2.4399, -2.2743, -0.1213, -2.0463, -2.2317, -0.4507])

We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also. | tensor([ 8.5069, -2.2273, -2.3291, -2.6115, -0.0730, -1.2651, -1.8564, -1.0621])

If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front. | tensor([ 1.9936, -2.8563,  0.5842, -3.0549, -3.5273,  5.6776,  0.6814, -0.3142])
Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. | tensor([ 8.4952, -1.9857, -1.6471, -2.1064, -1.3649, -2.3473, -2.2882,  0.2541])
We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. | tensor([ 4.2694, -3.4890, -0.0872, -2.7471, -0.0800,  3.1038, -0.9726, -1.6033])
About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). | tensor([ 4.8873, -3.0219, -1.1860, -3.4154, -0.5835,  5.0077, -0.9516, -2.1266])
We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. | tensor([ 8.4889, -1.5143, -2.7252, -2.7063,  0.5912, -2.2314, -1.9523, -0.7522])
She sent it back. | tensor([ 8.4873, -2.0969, -2.5680, -2.8006,  0.4924, -2.0709, -1.8890, -0.3461])
By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries. | tensor([ 2.9110, -4.1297,  0.9961, -3.2081, -0.6304,  4.7731, -0.8315, -1.7782])

We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. | tensor([ 5.6803, -1.1892, -2.3880, -2.4707,  4.0905, -0.8020, -2.9361, -1.1916])
No quick and easy app or beers on the house. | tensor([ 8.5894, -2.2564, -2.2100, -2.2087, -0.5066, -2.3601, -1.3878, -0.6641])
To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. | tensor([ 8.5054, -2.0210, -2.2523, -2.7491, -0.7236, -1.4094, -1.8524, -0.5003])
I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. | tensor([ 8.7507, -2.0497, -1.8188, -2.4774, -0.9495, -1.6318, -1.8654, -0.8333])
The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. | tensor([ 8.6799, -1.9461, -2.1457, -2.5168, -0.7372, -2.0489, -1.7530, -0.3836])
We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order. | tensor([ 8.6378, -2.3630, -2.0638, -2.5943, -0.5225, -1.9659, -1.3083, -0.8198])
I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. | tensor([ 8.6119, -2.3907, -1.7463, -2.3853, -0.7167, -2.2256, -1.5013, -0.6962])
I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. | tensor([ 8.4234, -1.0906, -2.6990, -2.2998, -0.5538, -2.5350, -2.3770,  0.5419])
It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\n\nThe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. | tensor([ 8.2123, -2.0943, -2.2458, -2.1698, -0.3445, -2.1740, -1.4907, -0.3966])
We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. | tensor([ 7.3914, -1.2858, -3.4301, -2.0893,  1.1438, -0.5040, -2.8646, -0.5706])
The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. | tensor([ 7.6635, -0.9894, -2.0425, -3.3452, -0.7504, -1.1532, -2.5880,  0.7564])
\n\nI'll definitely be back since I live in the area. | tensor([ 3.6645, -2.5137, -0.2878, -3.2221, -1.5215,  6.6619, -2.2284, -1.5230])
I've been to Duke's three times now. | tensor([ 8.5521, -1.6023, -2.4845, -2.3960, -0.3589, -2.3970, -2.2290,  0.1721])
When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. | tensor([-1.2446, -1.7033,  7.4171, -1.6761, -2.7542, -0.9050, -2.5077,  1.8360])
Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\n\nThey have an excellent new tap system. | tensor([ 8.0779, -1.3862, -2.2369, -2.4082, -0.9917, -1.1085, -2.0196, -0.2217])
Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. | tensor([ 8.2520, -1.5901, -2.1902, -2.3727, -0.9790, -0.6697, -2.1264, -0.6770])
The system really elevates already awesome beer. | tensor([ 8.4443, -1.7109, -2.3393, -2.3625, -0.5879, -1.5671, -1.9749, -0.7007])
Plus, the selection is awesome. | tensor([ 8.5337, -2.2323, -2.1094, -2.7484, -0.1229, -1.3952, -1.9459, -0.8463])
\n\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. | tensor([ 8.0731, -0.8771, -2.6158, -1.6863, -1.1789, -1.3846, -2.1752, -0.5398])
I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. | tensor([ 8.7222, -2.1651, -2.1466, -2.4110, -0.6049, -2.0583, -1.2287, -1.1233])
Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. | tensor([ 0.5168, -3.2262,  4.8763, -3.0987,  0.9057, -0.2955, -1.9464, -0.1335])
This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. | tensor([ 6.0645, -1.7753,  0.8435, -1.1799, -3.4301,  0.5482, -1.3181, -1.4776])
\n\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. | tensor([ 8.4871, -2.1338, -2.1322, -2.1499, -0.7257, -2.3284, -1.0522, -1.0562])
I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. | tensor([ 7.1196, -1.0167, -2.8603, -2.1561,  0.7535, -0.9793, -3.0222, -0.1004])
The first was flavorless and cold. | tensor([ 8.2268, -2.0528, -2.3418, -2.1724,  0.0806, -1.2284, -2.0611, -0.8056])
The second was passable, but nothing special. | tensor([ 7.8028, -2.4320, -2.1087, -1.8489, -0.0768, -0.3158, -2.1492, -1.1820])
And the last were absolutely awful. | tensor([ 8.2679, -1.8472, -2.1175, -2.5051, -0.2645, -1.4918, -2.4564, -0.0699])
Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. | tensor([ 8.4013, -0.9105, -2.5904, -2.1393, -0.7136, -2.0058, -2.0404, -0.4310])
I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. | tensor([ 8.4932, -1.5070, -2.5027, -2.7516, -0.3626, -1.9941, -1.8589, -0.0779])
\nTheir fries are very good. | tensor([ 7.8060, -2.1178, -2.2750, -2.5971,  1.5308, -1.9755, -2.5205, -0.7406])
And so are the wings.\n\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it. | tensor([ 8.4386, -1.4756, -2.7982, -1.5687, -0.4985, -2.7532, -1.5113, -0.4483])
D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. | tensor([ 8.1433, -1.0726, -2.3037, -0.8393, -1.1655, -1.9544, -2.1791, -0.8432])
They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. | tensor([ 8.1054, -1.7385, -2.3249, -2.1449, -0.5774, -1.5687, -1.7569, -0.6983])
You feel a bit milked afterwards. | tensor([ 8.0470, -1.3621, -2.8424, -2.4784,  0.1670, -1.5897, -2.3595, -0.1150])
Also much fatter.\n\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. | tensor([ 4.1303,  3.3148, -1.3946, -1.7564, -0.5914,  0.3864, -2.6687, -1.3180])
This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. | tensor([ 8.4448, -1.9115, -2.2000, -1.9410, -0.9338, -1.9122, -1.5282, -0.8893])
Menus for drinks and food have no prices. | tensor([ 8.1235, -2.8910, -1.2267, -2.3351, -0.2853, -1.6404, -1.3536, -1.6827])
$6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? | tensor([ 6.1279, -2.1410, -2.4746, -2.3141,  1.9782, -0.7046, -2.8216,  0.4371])
$3.40 for a Michelob? | tensor([ 7.3056, -1.7995, -1.7994, -2.3312,  0.4000, -2.1785, -2.0584,  0.0293])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\n\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. | tensor([ 8.2334, -2.3797, -2.3093, -1.7661, -0.6253, -2.1742, -0.5788, -1.4118])
Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\n\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. | tensor([ 8.1715, -0.8912, -2.8302, -1.5177, -1.0360, -2.3460, -2.4759,  0.4832])
Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\n\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant. | tensor([ 5.5150, -0.1176, -2.3124,  3.0050, -1.3638, -2.5100, -2.2816, -1.0183])
This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.\n\nWalking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.\n\nUn-nerving actually. | tensor([ 7.5834, -0.6027, -3.0447, -2.1697, -1.2995, -0.3733, -2.6704,  0.7989])
Dave and Buster's is all about excess. | tensor([ 8.3846, -1.4077, -2.3061, -2.4376, -0.8305, -1.6682, -2.3917, -0.0220])
Almost obscenely so.\n\nAs far as food - their stuff is standard. | tensor([ 8.2520, -1.7962, -1.6554, -2.5688, -0.9908, -1.2313, -2.0327, -0.8572])
Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. | tensor([ 8.4033, -1.5180, -2.1649, -1.5675, -1.2165, -1.5038, -1.8537, -0.9315])
At all actually. | tensor([ 8.5389, -2.2824, -2.2283, -2.7389, -0.0321, -1.7652, -1.9646, -0.3178])
You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.\n\nBut most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. | tensor([ 7.7905, -0.9790, -2.3401, -0.4326, -1.2445, -1.9260, -2.5972, -0.6366])
They come for the games.\n\nAnd while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have. | tensor([ 8.2006, -1.4253, -2.3583, -1.8115, -0.7081, -1.8502, -2.4809, -0.0724])

I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.\n\nEspecially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. | tensor([ 8.4278, -1.2083, -2.5738, -2.0767, -0.5729, -2.2509, -2.1320, -0.0219])
And proceeded to dominate.\n\nTrust. | tensor([ 8.4747, -2.4585, -2.0169, -2.6188, -0.3868, -1.4742, -0.9559, -1.5275])
I love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often. | tensor([ 8.4923, -1.6056, -2.4599, -2.2152, -0.8101, -1.4946, -2.3230, -0.1147])

The place is usually pretty clean.\n\nPool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you'll find in the city.\n\nFood is just \"ok\" Drink prices are fair but not great. | tensor([ 3.7232, -1.3149, -2.0839, -1.3628, -2.3133,  1.8095,  0.5106, -0.4764])
Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? | tensor([ 7.7984, -1.2736, -2.5293, -0.9417, -1.5048, -2.4305, -2.6405,  1.0426])
Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \n\nNext, the food. | tensor([ 0.4826, -2.8387, -0.4457,  0.8294, -0.5804,  0.7978,  2.0128, -2.1435])
Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. | tensor([-0.0215, -0.9090, -0.3392, -1.5293, -1.9117,  0.5595, -1.1837,  5.0359])
\n\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. | tensor([ 8.3701, -1.6122, -2.4781, -2.0558, -0.9221, -2.0213, -2.1612,  0.3930])
I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\n\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century. | tensor([ 8.0794, -1.8438, -2.2889, -2.6038, -1.3424, -1.1066, -1.7836,  0.3217])
The food was absolutely gross! | tensor([ 8.6604, -2.1278, -2.0081, -2.3071, -0.4459, -2.2403, -1.5708, -0.9256])
I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. | tensor([ 7.2208, -2.7983, -1.8298, -2.7089,  0.2331, -0.3798, -1.5912, -0.8888])
What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! | tensor([ 7.6710, -2.4502, -2.6524, -3.0961,  0.8314,  0.1286, -1.8750, -1.1034])
First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! | tensor([ 8.4971, -1.6608, -2.4150, -2.0973, -0.2097, -2.3951, -1.3257, -1.2384])
There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! | tensor([ 8.0703, -1.5626, -2.5405, -2.6760,  0.0362, -1.7766, -0.9191, -1.4283])
No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! | tensor([ 7.3409, -0.9744, -3.2178, -2.9233,  1.2576, -0.0123, -2.6259, -0.9469])
\n\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too. | tensor([ 0.8004, -0.0992, -2.7484, -1.5373,  8.2315, -1.1868, -2.3198, -0.4026])
  \n\nThe manager was really nice... | tensor([ 8.5844, -1.7187, -2.6056, -2.6478,  0.0188, -2.1810, -1.8001, -0.2954])
Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free. | tensor([ 8.6484, -2.1451, -2.1762, -2.3419, -0.5516, -2.1829, -1.6206, -0.6226])
Not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...\n\nPool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour\n(I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)\n\nMixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.\nThe food is crap.\n\nThe games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).\n\nThat is all. | tensor([ 8.3895, -1.3967, -2.7334, -2.2734, -0.5343, -1.8597, -2.2987, -0.0304])
 :)\n\n(the pricing is based on my recent trip.\nWe shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60 | tensor([ 7.4651, -1.6459, -3.1326, -2.6392,  0.0569, -2.4619, -2.2916,  1.9692])
Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. | tensor([ 7.5229, -0.3980, -2.2942, -0.9624, -0.7911, -2.5919, -3.0934,  0.4394])
There is many fun games and prizes to win. | tensor([ 8.0258, -1.5025, -1.9016, -1.9717, -0.8275, -1.1022, -2.6817, -0.2809])
I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. | tensor([ 8.5826, -1.9352, -2.1411, -2.0593, -0.7226, -2.1955, -2.0852, -0.2944])
Food is pretty good and a nice bar. | tensor([ 8.5948, -2.1527, -2.0423, -2.2871, -0.5795, -1.4229, -2.3270, -0.6629])
The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey. | tensor([ 1.3210, -1.5348, -2.1459, -2.3788,  7.9118, -0.8026, -2.9682,  0.2974])
When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? | tensor([ 8.5062, -1.6764, -2.3170, -2.3972, -0.4101, -2.1204, -2.3024, -0.0622])
Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. | tensor([ 8.3860, -1.1603, -2.3641, -2.6802, -1.0805, -2.4267, -1.8296,  0.4724])
I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. | tensor([ 8.1602, -2.0802, -2.0560, -2.2538, -0.7567, -2.2876, -1.7304,  0.5612])
AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. | tensor([ 7.6507, -0.3933, -2.5412, -0.6458, -1.4109, -1.8669, -2.7708,  0.1789])
When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. | tensor([ 8.0579, -0.4658, -2.0081, -2.6221, -1.8337, -2.0841, -2.3358,  1.2198])
We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. | tensor([ 8.4520, -1.7880, -2.3593, -2.2511, -0.3543, -2.2474, -2.1520,  0.1321])
This time, it was ridiculous. | tensor([ 8.5430, -2.4843, -2.0496, -2.6460, -0.4442, -1.4374, -1.5530, -0.9414])
It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. | tensor([ 8.4825, -1.5034, -2.4644, -2.6483, -0.5762, -1.9602, -1.4553, -0.5889])
The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. | tensor([ 3.9663,  0.1007, -3.3715,  0.7727,  4.6558, -2.3287, -1.9578, -2.2094])
I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. | tensor([ 3.8285,  1.9935, -2.9390,  1.5881, -0.3944, -1.1521, -1.5285, -1.7624])
Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. | tensor([ 3.5509,  3.6710, -2.5799, -1.2246, -1.8714, -2.5189, -0.6068,  1.6753])
Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- | tensor([ 8.4666, -2.2174, -2.1937, -2.2390,  0.0124, -2.4241, -1.5253, -0.8267])
I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. | tensor([ 8.5976, -1.9870, -2.0615, -2.1215, -0.9611, -2.3725, -1.6189, -0.1518])
I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. | tensor([ 8.3282, -2.5258, -2.4470, -1.2428, -0.1974, -1.9815, -1.1977, -1.4885])
It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. | tensor([ 4.6142, -2.1841, -2.0181, -1.8368,  4.3033, -2.0540, -2.2442, -0.5923])
He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. | tensor([ 7.4672, -2.0871, -1.1843, -1.4035, -1.9613, -0.6132, -2.3283, -0.1303])
After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. | tensor([ 8.5054, -1.9138, -2.1991, -1.9934, -0.8016, -1.8323, -2.3300, -0.0657])
\nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. | tensor([-0.7312, -2.3068,  1.5725, -2.2510, -2.1261,  7.8593, -1.4285, -0.6482])
The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. | tensor([ 8.2389, -1.9666, -2.2827, -3.0335, -0.4391, -1.0168, -1.4597, -0.9088])
For $14, it wasn't worth it. | tensor([ 8.4529, -2.1104, -2.3373, -2.7923,  0.0426, -1.6349, -2.0041, -0.4398])
\nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. | tensor([ 8.2180, -2.4134, -2.2522, -1.1810, -1.4655, -1.6912, -1.6698, -0.1063])
\nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. | tensor([ 8.5689, -1.8697, -2.2112, -2.4219, -1.1682, -1.2121, -1.9259, -0.3859])
I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. | tensor([ 6.6039,  0.8748, -3.1713, -1.6195, -0.6707, -2.2656, -3.2930,  2.2746])
but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. | tensor([ 8.4963e+00, -1.2694e+00, -2.2041e+00, -2.4808e+00, -1.1096e+00,
        -2.1293e+00, -2.1266e+00,  7.4831e-03])
If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork. | tensor([ 8.5221, -1.9929, -1.4021, -2.0987, -1.6808, -2.1119, -1.6493, -0.3549])
Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. | tensor([ 8.5371, -1.5859, -2.2710, -1.8971, -0.8886, -2.1107, -2.3350, -0.1415])
\n\nDining: 2 stars\n\nI had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. | tensor([ 8.5914, -2.3213, -2.1890, -2.6546, -0.4026, -2.2790, -1.1964, -0.6475])
They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. | tensor([ 8.5037, -2.0192, -2.4343, -2.0091, -0.1670, -2.4434, -2.0432, -0.0205])
She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. | tensor([ 8.4465, -1.8173, -2.4892, -2.0859,  0.2497, -2.3801, -1.9064, -0.6165])
And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. | tensor([ 4.8407, -2.7096, -1.2596, -2.4941, -2.0183, -1.5487,  4.3653, -2.3283])
Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. | tensor([ 8.5171, -2.0336, -2.5978, -2.8282,  0.3563, -1.7523, -1.7510, -0.8059])
But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. | tensor([-0.7339, -0.6019, -1.7972, -1.4092,  1.8289,  0.8014,  2.2352, -0.2689])
I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. | tensor([ 6.8982, -2.7699, -2.0570, -2.4317,  1.9845, -2.2346, -0.7703, -1.2936])
BUT, our service was rather haphazard. | tensor([ 8.6238, -2.4609, -1.8375, -2.6836, -0.6345, -2.0908, -1.0304, -1.0977])
People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. | tensor([ 8.4172, -2.3004, -2.2432, -1.7128, -0.4065, -1.6326, -1.8552, -0.8651])
One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. | tensor([ 8.1121, -2.2892, -2.2888, -0.5610, -0.2471, -2.2820, -2.2022, -0.5858])
I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. | tensor([ 7.8000, -1.6987, -2.8685, -2.2192,  0.3427, -2.1014, -1.1866, -0.7856])
It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. | tensor([ 8.4244, -2.2809, -2.4162, -2.3246, -0.0199, -1.4671, -1.9786, -0.6519])
Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. | tensor([ 7.9774, -1.0365, -2.8092, -0.4890, -1.1871, -2.9232, -1.8868, -0.0915])
In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n\nBar: 1 Star\n\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. | tensor([ 8.4311, -1.9393, -2.2558, -2.0568, -0.7571, -1.6048, -1.6564, -0.8009])
The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. | tensor([ 8.1480, -2.2689, -2.2145, -1.8545, -0.5711, -1.3343, -1.8399, -0.8307])
Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. | tensor([ 8.6118, -1.5347, -2.5742, -1.5378, -0.6752, -2.3393, -1.2771, -1.2538])
You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n\nArcade: 4 Stars\n\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. | tensor([ 8.5312, -2.2965, -2.0623, -1.9033, -1.0135, -1.7801, -1.2487, -1.0341])
It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. | tensor([ 7.2713, -0.4776, -2.3917, -1.3018, -0.6735, -2.2843, -3.2040,  0.8153])
If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. | tensor([ 6.4960, -2.2344, -2.4718, -1.8785,  3.0509, -1.5093, -2.8624, -0.6208])
The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. | tensor([ 8.1967, -1.6799, -2.8965, -2.1636, -0.1919, -2.0456, -0.2558, -1.4262])
The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n\n\nOverall: | tensor([ 8.2987, -2.5014, -2.4147, -1.4240, -0.5480, -1.7050, -1.3360, -1.0012])
3 Stars\n\nIf you want to hang out here | tensor([ 8.6136, -2.2371, -2.1522, -2.2393, -0.1214, -2.2125, -1.5843, -1.0273])
, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile. | tensor([ 8.6642, -1.8161, -2.1630, -1.8719, -0.7874, -2.2731, -2.2013, -0.3110])
Chuckie Cheese for grown ups... | tensor([ 8.3750e+00, -1.7039e+00, -2.2839e+00, -2.5639e+00,  5.7751e-03,

Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\n\nFirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's. | tensor([ 8.6392, -1.6166, -2.3753, -2.2105, -0.5822, -1.9439, -1.8763, -0.6364])

Second, I actually experience all of it while here. | tensor([ 8.5144, -2.1461, -2.3022, -2.7128, -0.3220, -1.4701, -2.1491, -0.2493])

We will start with the food/service. | tensor([ 8.3113, -2.4712, -2.0131, -2.6049,  0.3578, -1.5452, -1.9317, -1.0979])

Staff, you were wonderful. | tensor([ 8.4487, -1.8887, -2.4072, -2.7005,  0.1399, -1.5507, -2.3872, -0.3427])

You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery. | tensor([ 8.6730, -2.2325, -2.3885, -2.4406,  0.0651, -1.9375, -1.5796, -1.1661])

We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. | tensor([ 8.6459, -1.9108, -2.1757, -2.5662, -0.6994, -1.7403, -1.6717, -0.5843])

\n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. | tensor([ 8.4404, -2.1191, -2.3311, -1.5645, -0.8248, -2.0842, -1.6651, -0.5745])

We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. | tensor([ 7.4669, -0.8714, -2.1884, -2.1926, -0.6393, -1.3151, -3.1997,  0.6524])

I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. | tensor([ 4.8961,  0.0435, -2.8992, -0.3228, -3.1394, -0.0973, -1.6143,  2.4660])
The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. | tensor([ 8.3384, -1.1772, -1.9982, -1.7606, -1.3263, -1.5271, -2.6241, -0.2191])
It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! | tensor([ 7.3897, -1.9314, -2.2492, -0.7958, -1.1611, -1.8865, -1.1616, -0.3165])

Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. | tensor([ 8.5608, -1.8100, -2.2154, -2.5489, -1.0898, -1.7216, -1.8992, -0.0618])
I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets. | tensor([ 8.3306e+00, -1.8642e+00, -2.2409e+00, -1.1376e+00, -1.2092e+00,

It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.   | tensor([ 0.8178, -1.7645, -1.9694, -1.3292,  7.6426, -1.4798, -2.2175, -0.0393])

On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! | tensor([ 7.3962, -0.1793, -2.7814, -0.2621, -1.8733, -2.7429, -0.8741, -0.4811])

Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). | tensor([ 7.9246, -1.6898, -2.5404, -0.7915, -1.4292, -2.0430, -2.0325,  0.3443])

First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. | tensor([ 8.6588, -1.8130, -2.3916, -2.0251, -0.4637, -2.3464, -1.3975, -1.0130])

As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order. | tensor([ 7.6985, -2.6286, -2.2367, -3.1841,  0.1398, -0.6719, -1.5394, -0.0667])

Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.   | tensor([ 8.5946, -1.5554, -2.3800, -2.5178, -0.1756, -2.4655, -1.9185,  0.0915])
Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task. | tensor([ 4.4188, -2.0478, -2.4426, -0.9307,  4.9760, -2.8548, -2.1693, -0.3025])

but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\n\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.   | tensor([ 1.7201, -1.5460, -0.7646, -3.3825, -2.1748,  3.2046, -0.6613,  3.1916])
They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products. | tensor([ 8.3823, -2.6067, -0.8122, -1.7989, -1.1194, -2.2398, -1.9925, -0.9992])

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\n\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels. | tensor([ 3.1149, -2.6455, -1.6854,  0.2717,  2.8921,  0.8704, -1.1384, -2.3472])

We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. | tensor([ 8.5045, -1.3302, -2.1600, -2.3535, -0.7880, -2.0489, -1.5986, -0.9996])
\n\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken. | tensor([ 2.3898, -2.7876, -0.9393, -2.2103,  1.5371,  4.2914, -0.8353, -1.8210])

In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion. | tensor([ 8.0050, -2.3944, -2.6688, -2.9517,  1.3864, -1.1259, -2.3151, -0.6595])

With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree. | tensor([ 7.1494, -1.8807, -1.8820, -1.4224, -0.0623, -1.1804, -1.3251, -1.9443])

They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\n\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews. | tensor([ 8.0749, -2.0261, -1.1599, -2.3436, -0.8075, -2.4263, -2.6179,  0.0798])

They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \"Lumpy Dog\" to a dark \"Brew masters Choice.\"   | tensor([ 4.7002, -3.0563,  0.1909, -2.4201, -3.0131,  3.0138, -0.3127, -1.3855])
I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them. | tensor([ 8.5566, -2.0162, -2.3516, -1.9030, -0.6347, -1.8687, -2.2969, -0.2666])

I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack. | tensor([ 8.0630, -1.9419, -1.3734, -2.7468, -0.9650, -1.6892, -2.5074,  0.1963])

Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\n\nI give it 3 out of 5 | tensor([ 8.2216, -1.3478, -1.5734, -2.0056, -1.3468, -2.5564, -2.1828,  0.0845])
Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place. | tensor([ 8.5762, -2.2723, -2.0564, -2.1475, -0.5462, -2.1365, -1.8491, -0.4287])

I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds. | tensor([ 7.9751, -1.2614, -2.5677, -1.8744, -0.3845, -2.0378, -1.7374, -0.6972])

 Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty. | tensor([ 8.5453, -2.6015, -2.2863, -1.9867, -0.2115, -2.1505, -1.3912, -0.9560])

Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more. | tensor([ 8.5344, -1.9444, -2.4469, -1.5184, -0.6658, -2.3640, -1.6809, -0.4578])

While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\n\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried... | tensor([ 0.7733, -2.0878, -1.9180, -2.0064,  7.8907, -1.3608, -2.3777,  0.2288])

Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future. | tensor([ 8.5460, -1.6903, -2.2702, -2.3996, -0.9123, -1.9325, -1.9866, -0.0159])

As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night. | tensor([ 7.0417, -1.5622, -2.3943, -3.4635,  0.9230, -2.1641, -2.4972,  2.1455])
 Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table. | tensor([ 7.7205, -2.0290, -2.3755, -2.8365, -0.4078, -1.3306, -2.0002,  0.7324])

Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful. | tensor([ 8.4423, -2.0937, -2.3459, -2.2431, -0.0197, -2.0450, -1.9428, -0.6219])

Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers. | tensor([ 8.6499, -2.1833, -2.0720, -2.6626, -0.4620, -2.0651, -1.8804, -0.2702])

We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"   | tensor([ 8.1568, -1.1945, -2.5031, -3.0518,  0.1223, -2.2652, -1.1603, -0.6039])
In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell). | tensor([ 8.4640, -1.8834, -2.0342, -2.2990, -0.7788, -2.2899, -2.3287,  0.3038])

I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer. | tensor([ 7.9818, -0.6019, -1.7967, -3.0849, -1.6482, -1.8353, -1.8282,  0.7549])

I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.   | tensor([ 8.2871, -1.8870, -2.7844, -2.6890,  0.7587, -1.2326, -2.3215, -0.9057])
So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it. | tensor([ 8.5168, -1.8790, -2.4430, -2.7385, -0.0815, -1.9853, -2.1056, -0.1625])

\n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.   | tensor([ 1.2621, -2.7474,  3.7368, -3.9442, -2.8332,  4.6247, -0.7857, -0.6459])
They were okay, but not quite what I expected. | tensor([ 8.4972, -1.4298, -2.0593, -2.2649, -0.9536, -1.9729, -2.4994,  0.2107])

The spicy ranch was top notch, though. | tensor([ 4.6823, -1.7707, -1.0785, -3.3050, -2.0713,  5.3315, -1.0472, -1.9542])

As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger. | tensor([ 4.1792, -2.4719,  1.3687, -3.4360, -2.4248,  2.0854, -2.0546,  0.9495])

They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium). | tensor([ 8.4508, -2.0047, -2.0727, -2.7269, -0.3808, -1.4769, -2.3448, -0.3248])

And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler. | tensor([ 8.2756, -1.7046, -2.0556, -3.4441, -1.3659, -0.7532, -0.8755, -0.6933])

The glass container itself is sold for $12.95. | tensor([ 8.3732, -2.6319, -2.0002, -2.7332, -0.3285, -1.6374, -1.4724, -0.5774])

That's the empty price. | tensor([ 8.3246, -2.1926, -1.9862, -3.0034, -0.4997, -1.3270, -1.6264, -0.6234])

To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.   | tensor([ 4.0091, -1.7380, -1.4298, -0.1976, -1.4625, -2.9023, -1.1232,  2.9736])
Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me. | tensor([ 8.3407, -1.3333, -2.5269, -2.5218, -0.7678, -2.1682, -1.9863,  0.3837])

So I walked out empty handed. | tensor([ 8.5936, -2.3593, -1.9558, -2.4990, -0.5903, -1.8367, -1.5060, -0.8280])

But it won't deter me from returning. | tensor([ 8.5339, -2.2398, -1.7848, -2.4435, -0.6490, -1.4592, -2.1182, -0.7754])
Slow service\nBelow average food \nIll pass | tensor([ 7.9113, -2.9358, -1.4410, -1.3503, -1.1053, -1.1147, -1.3299, -1.6118])
Its not bad. | tensor([ 8.5273, -1.9850, -1.9030, -2.6821, -0.2781, -1.2440, -2.4912, -0.5151])
I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. | tensor([ 8.0431, -2.1072, -2.4758, -1.6217, -1.0217, -2.3907, -0.9840, -0.0993])
I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time. | tensor([ 8.6559, -2.1037, -2.2173, -2.1979, -0.3492, -2.4302, -1.7638, -0.4662])
Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. | tensor([ 1.2506, -1.2506,  1.6435, -4.3580, -1.3980,  1.2662, -2.6426,  4.6396])
My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. | tensor([ 8.3863, -2.0741, -2.5001, -2.4063,  0.1224, -1.9061, -2.0043, -0.3365])
The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. | tensor([ 2.8605, -1.9005, -2.1598, -1.5514,  4.6111,  0.1614, -1.8242, -1.2460])
If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! | tensor([ 8.2732, -1.7838, -1.7128, -2.4829, -1.0176, -1.4593, -2.3401, -0.1831])
\n\nMondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. | tensor([-0.5414, -2.9017,  1.5424, -1.5825, -1.4716,  6.9828, -1.4708, -0.6882])
It was delish! | tensor([ 8.4545, -2.0814, -2.4651, -1.6535,  0.0517, -2.5781, -1.8569, -0.5368])
The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. | tensor([ 7.7917, -1.5754, -2.0883, -2.5333,  0.1398, -1.2677, -2.7974, -0.4456])
\n\nThe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. | tensor([ 7.4619,  0.4861, -2.8211, -2.0821, -1.2697, -2.6076, -0.7605, -0.3696])
I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. | tensor([ 8.4394, -1.9729, -2.0704, -1.6887, -0.9184, -1.8468, -1.7202, -1.1098])
\n\nI felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. | tensor([ 4.2330, -0.7941, -3.2475, -2.9588,  5.4887, -0.7031, -1.3073, -1.7748])
The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour. | tensor([ 8.5752, -2.0008, -2.1540, -2.2014, -0.3788, -2.4472, -2.1147, -0.0345])
Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\". | tensor([ 7.2675, -0.6281, -1.2573, -3.2420, -1.6766, -2.1846, -2.5132,  2.0942])

The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. | tensor([ 8.4465, -1.8093, -2.3097, -2.0605, -0.1100, -1.7877, -2.5440, -0.4678])
They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. | tensor([ 6.9253, -2.4058,  2.0942, -2.0183, -2.8213, -2.1772, -2.1891, -0.4911])
I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. | tensor([ 8.7016, -2.2310, -1.9052, -2.4738, -0.6985, -2.0090, -1.7708, -0.5396])
food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. | tensor([ 8.3926, -1.9881, -1.8414, -2.1717, -0.9481, -1.6485, -2.5107, -0.2112])
I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\n\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub | tensor([ 8.5445, -1.9685, -1.9650, -1.8891, -0.5995, -2.5105, -1.9774, -0.5722])
but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. | tensor([ 2.4981, -2.8919,  3.4546, -1.5526, -1.1179,  0.5950, -1.1457, -1.6948])
If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens! | tensor([ 6.4232, -1.9156, -1.7538, -2.8247, -1.7192, -2.1552, -1.1438,  2.8237])
Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. | tensor([ 8.4470, -2.2836, -1.7096, -2.2782, -1.0773, -1.4052, -2.1859, -0.2926])
Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in... | tensor([ 8.5375, -1.8866, -2.4273, -1.7413, -0.6122, -2.0598, -1.8188, -0.7504])
you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad | tensor([ 8.1773, -1.4251, -1.9939, -1.8304, -1.1262, -0.8140, -2.3248, -0.8913])
and I'd be ready to go on to the next review | tensor([ 8.6800, -2.0754, -2.3073, -2.4750, -0.1229, -2.1151, -1.8192, -0.5778])
right there.\n\nHere's where I ran into problems. | tensor([ 8.4482e+00, -1.9471e+00, -2.3810e+00, -2.6669e+00, -5.4175e-03,
        -1.7989e+00, -2.1300e+00, -2.9664e-01])
I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. | tensor([ 8.1633, -1.3853, -2.7026, -1.9135,  0.0858, -2.3349, -1.9446, -0.7169])
Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. | tensor([ 7.7081, -0.9436, -2.0912, -0.5081, -0.0690, -2.5418, -2.2615, -1.4116])
Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? | tensor([ 8.4934, -2.2259, -2.1927, -2.3171, -0.1103, -1.6993, -1.9679, -0.7811])
\n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. | tensor([ 8.3523, -2.3932, -1.9998, -1.9052, -0.3389, -2.4884, -0.9044, -1.2371])
Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. | tensor([ 6.8149, -1.0537, -2.4993,  1.0331, -0.9937, -1.9515, -2.0358, -1.4532])
I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed. | tensor([ 8.4320, -1.6463, -2.6768, -2.3163, -0.2998, -1.8500, -1.9287, -0.2666])
Nothing special. | tensor([ 8.5020, -2.4974, -2.0137, -2.2071, -0.3991, -1.4233, -2.0836, -0.6338])
Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. | tensor([ 7.3558, -1.8444, -1.9769, -2.1583, -0.8118, -0.6299, -2.5860,  0.4499])
Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. | tensor([ 8.5231, -2.2658, -2.2359, -2.0879, -0.1550, -1.5950, -1.9908, -0.9754])
\n\nThis was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. | tensor([-0.9544, -0.6921,  2.9307, -3.3324, -2.1331, -0.8240, -1.9125,  6.1077])
The first time almost ten years ago. | tensor([ 8.2169, -2.0544, -2.1315, -2.8601, -0.1652, -1.2173, -2.4158,  0.0766])
We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. | tensor([ 7.6975, -2.0867, -0.2720, -2.6835, -2.2653, -0.5938, -1.2856, -1.3023])
How do you do that on Fathers Day?! | tensor([ 6.5731, -2.3562, -0.3910, -2.7804, -1.4415, -0.8516, -1.3505,  0.0537])
This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\n\nMy wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. | tensor([ 7.2237, -1.3173, -2.9553, -2.6004,  1.6475, -1.4153, -3.0222,  0.4484])
She just said it had too much ice in it. | tensor([ 8.2906, -1.5961, -2.5507, -3.2663,  0.2879, -1.7646, -1.6073, -0.4195])
Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\n\nWe started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. | tensor([ 5.9587, -1.1178, -2.2477, -3.4529,  0.6893,  0.1324, -2.8754,  0.9158])
It took at least 15 minutes to get them. | tensor([ 7.3593, -2.4924, -0.8952, -2.6448, -0.8929, -1.0648, -1.3422, -0.8452])
You get three sliders and they were very good.\n\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. | tensor([ 1.1103, -2.2928, -2.3861, -2.7816,  6.9306,  1.2423, -1.8428, -0.3587])
She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\n\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. | tensor([ 1.3443,  4.1176, -1.1318, -3.6116, -0.6689, -0.4586, -1.4205,  3.0742])
No surprise there.\n\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. | tensor([-8.0217e-01, -2.8933e+00, -7.9960e-04, -3.0086e+00, -1.8586e+00,

My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. | tensor([ 8.4846, -1.5235, -2.5387, -2.8620, -0.4550, -1.5784, -2.1300, -0.0193])
Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. | tensor([ 7.4551, -2.3738, -1.3752, -3.4546, -1.7008,  0.5000, -2.3109,  1.0266])
The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. | tensor([ 7.9109, -1.5382, -2.2413, -2.3017, -0.9394, -0.4135, -1.6103, -1.1496])

The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\n\nOn a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. | tensor([ 0.0545, -0.9953, -2.0972, -2.0387,  8.3997, -2.0942, -1.6324,  0.5483])

The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home. | tensor([ 6.0957,  0.9889, -2.0547,  0.5689, -1.6791, -3.0840, -1.8164, -0.6917])

I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along. | tensor([ 1.6441, -1.8251, -2.5119, -2.4068,  8.2310, -1.5004, -2.3072,  0.5274])

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.) | tensor([ 7.4653, -1.3943, -2.7583, -1.9489,  0.2022, -1.1552, -2.6208, -0.3918])

The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed. | tensor([ 8.4082, -2.3932, -2.1250, -2.1609, -0.4069, -1.8871, -1.6459, -0.8754])

My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection. | tensor([ 7.9078, -2.5419, -1.6493, -1.3373, -1.1405, -0.7846, -1.6987, -1.2747])

The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.   | tensor([ 1.8188, -2.6626, -1.8285, -0.5344,  5.4270, -0.6659, -1.8158, -1.2650])
My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.   | tensor([ 7.3940, -0.5171, -2.2449, -1.8352, -1.6364, -2.0834, -1.8434,  0.7140])
Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by. | tensor([ 8.1461, -1.7652, -2.5969, -1.6034, -1.1821, -1.5538, -2.0383,  0.5489])

It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. | tensor([ 7.5668, -0.2291, -2.2301, -2.7281, -1.7197,  0.6624, -1.8431, -0.9623])

This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. | tensor([ 8.2444, -0.8246, -1.8935, -2.1434, -1.4641, -1.7799, -2.3936,  0.2751])
To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. | tensor([ 8.1550, -1.2808, -2.1476, -3.0224, -0.0543, -1.8794, -2.3416, -0.0680])
Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing. | tensor([ 8.4856, -1.4542, -2.4955, -2.1189, -0.4012, -2.2451, -2.1200, -0.2806])

He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\n\nWe walked in around 8pm | tensor([ 8.1499, -1.2503, -2.2408, -1.7507, -0.7862, -1.4717, -2.6993, -0.2840])

Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. | tensor([ 8.1459, -1.7034, -2.0474, -1.5420, -1.5966, -1.9495, -2.1869,  0.3480])
Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. | tensor([ 8.5074, -1.9732, -2.6418, -2.9366,  0.6771, -2.4414, -1.4099, -0.6472])
She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. | tensor([ 1.5256e+00, -3.5472e-03, -2.6023e+00, -1.7657e+00,  7.4643e+00,

Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. | tensor([ 8.4123, -1.8668, -2.1967, -2.0452, -0.2935, -2.5532, -2.5623,  0.3697])
He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. | tensor([ 8.0827, -1.9106, -2.4108, -1.4518, -0.0623, -1.4084, -2.5686, -0.6571])
Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. | tensor([ 8.5205, -1.9468, -2.2568, -2.6149, -0.2429, -2.1934, -2.0720, -0.2176])

\n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.   | tensor([ 5.5548, -1.8995, -2.2082, -1.5835,  0.3399,  1.8943, -2.4370, -1.2193])
Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. | tensor([ 8.6457, -1.7685, -2.3186, -2.5916, -0.4879, -2.1501, -1.9701, -0.1677])

Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... | tensor([ 5.7342, -2.2212, -2.6683, -1.9552, -0.1413,  0.7135, -1.6225,  0.7400])
Yuck.\n\nOverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. | tensor([ 5.9415, -2.7670,  1.2387, -1.3921, -1.7420, -1.0312, -1.4131, -1.8206])

The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table. | tensor([ 6.7294, -1.8353, -2.1639, -0.5961,  0.4551, -1.9135, -2.3356, -0.2966])

As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left. | tensor([ 8.6118, -1.9644, -1.9174, -2.5405, -0.3216, -1.9314, -2.0113, -0.8112])
 \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.   | tensor([ 8.7310, -1.9987, -2.4613, -2.5054, -0.2133, -2.3270, -1.2785, -0.9199])
The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst. | tensor([ 8.5115, -2.4607, -2.3880, -2.1713, -0.3683, -2.0459, -1.4177, -0.7887])

I ordered the mini street fish tacos. | tensor([ 0.8454, -2.0097,  0.3063, -2.2162, -0.2046,  6.6469, -2.4134, -0.3141])

I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? | tensor([ 2.7601, -0.9556, -0.1116, -1.0878, -0.4415,  3.9326, -3.2884, -0.4878])

you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.\n\nAll in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good. | tensor([ 5.3659, -2.1661, -3.3038, -3.1385,  2.3305, -1.3732, -0.1520,  0.6358])

Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.\n\nThe food leaves little to be desired. | tensor([ 8.6424, -2.1379, -2.3451, -2.1517, -0.1461, -2.2543, -1.8715, -0.6910])

I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. | tensor([ 8.2810, -2.2072, -2.2203, -2.7391, -0.3408, -0.8564, -1.8482, -0.6801])

All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks. | tensor([ 8.5355, -1.4843, -2.6089, -1.9171, -0.5954, -2.3415, -1.8545, -0.1497])

At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. | tensor([ 8.5230, -2.1033, -2.2724, -1.3576, -0.8621, -2.4396, -1.5891, -0.7449])
You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. | tensor([ 1.9825, -2.7897, -1.1690,  4.5400, -1.5863, -0.4972, -1.7133, -0.2593])
That seemd reasonable. | tensor([ 8.4855, -2.4367, -2.2434, -2.2591, -0.0727, -1.9649, -1.5397, -1.0423])
The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. | tensor([ 8.3163, -2.3962, -2.1556, -2.4886, -0.4207, -2.3527, -1.7172,  0.4197])
They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! | tensor([ 7.6602, -2.9082, -0.9805, -3.1472, -0.1693, -0.8377, -1.8464, -0.2650])
Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. | tensor([ 8.3841, -2.5607, -2.1637, -1.3797, -0.6052, -2.2615, -1.3923, -0.9544])

The same thing happened to many of my friends. | tensor([ 8.5587, -2.0402, -2.2453, -2.1666, -0.5661, -2.0745, -2.0646, -0.1467])
It's a classic bait & switch. | tensor([ 6.9519, -2.6767, -1.0010, -1.9228, -1.8428,  0.6316, -1.5606, -0.8590])
These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. | tensor([ 8.2714, -2.5164, -1.9953, -1.7245, -0.4136, -2.3125, -1.5881, -0.7236])
In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. | tensor([ 7.0804, -2.7220,  0.0136, -2.6097, -1.1532, -1.8628, -1.6312,  0.0553])
\n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. | tensor([ 7.7390, -2.8630, -1.6264, -2.0906, -0.7474, -1.5022, -1.3308, -0.5817])

How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? | tensor([ 1.9438, -2.1817, -1.5549,  4.8231, -1.5023, -1.8733, -2.0735,  0.8773])
\n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. | tensor([ 8.0928, -2.6383, -2.0744, -1.4673, -1.2640, -2.1358, -1.1560,  0.2051])
\n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. | tensor([ 8.4080, -2.4016, -2.1225, -2.3222, -0.5110, -1.7559, -1.0635, -1.2174])
\n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers. | tensor([ 8.4992, -2.5953, -2.0314, -2.0074, -1.0279, -1.5169, -1.1928, -0.9082])
The place does what it does best - Comedy.   | tensor([ 5.3440, -1.0071, -2.0797,  1.8917, -1.5433, -2.9553, -2.6124,  1.1566])
The food, however. | tensor([ 8.3558, -2.5305, -1.9930, -2.8888,  0.0707, -1.3946, -1.7298, -1.1116])
 Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.   | tensor([ 8.0070, -1.6564, -3.3027, -1.1004, -0.1214, -2.3622, -1.2468, -0.6513])
This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each. | tensor([ 7.7333, -2.5562, -2.4407, -0.4621, -0.2815, -2.0015, -1.4311, -1.0629])
   \n\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS! | tensor([ 4.0153, -0.8758, -1.1002,  0.7263, -0.9402, -2.3513,  1.1706, -2.2904])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I learned that one the hard way. | tensor([ 8.5372, -2.0714, -2.3979, -2.8521, -0.2129, -1.5480, -1.7322, -0.5918])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Get water. | tensor([ 7.5126, -2.1700, -1.7734, -2.4932,  0.0545, -1.1450, -2.4601,  0.3390])
\n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out. | tensor([ 7.8430, -1.4060, -3.1170, -2.5795,  1.4558, -2.4223, -0.7339, -1.1916])
 Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.   | tensor([ 8.5878, -1.9556, -2.4167, -2.1705, -0.5637, -2.2706, -1.3885, -0.8606])
Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity. | tensor([ 8.6060, -2.2102, -2.2936, -2.4955, -0.1080, -2.2844, -1.1916, -0.9517])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk. | tensor([ 8.4214, -1.8724, -2.5937, -2.4770,  0.0787, -2.3389, -1.9358, -0.1635])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%. | tensor([ 8.5066, -1.5276, -2.7039, -3.1937,  0.7502, -2.2083, -1.8407, -0.3783])
    | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
\n\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show. | tensor([ 4.6206, -0.5963, -2.0399,  4.1777, -1.8179, -2.6751, -1.6250, -1.2320])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again. | tensor([ 7.8855, -1.6049, -2.7006, -0.7914, -1.2434, -2.5485, -2.4620,  0.7177])
The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.   | tensor([ 7.4815, -1.6767, -3.0651, -1.0150, -0.8003, -2.2747, -1.8350,  0.8459])
The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.   | tensor([ 6.6717, -1.6984, -2.2042, -2.6674, -1.2799,  0.4252, -2.0842,  1.0795])
Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.   | tensor([ 8.3883, -2.5399, -2.2290, -1.1981, -0.9630, -1.7798, -1.4780, -0.8808])
They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show. | tensor([ 8.1356, -1.7453, -2.3734, -1.5604, -1.1310, -2.0629, -1.4877, -0.6937])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.   | tensor([ 7.8603, -1.9877, -1.1734, -1.5293, -2.0337, -1.1959, -0.7165, -1.6525])
You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place. | tensor([ 2.4458, -1.0669, -2.0875,  4.8632, -1.4606, -2.3696, -0.7787, -0.8293])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians. | tensor([ 8.1369, -1.2713, -2.6396, -1.1543, -0.9208, -2.1785, -1.8586, -0.6864])
 Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them. | tensor([ 8.5011, -2.2331, -2.4905, -1.7849, -0.2338, -2.5881, -1.2870, -0.7941])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here. | tensor([ 8.2871, -1.8730, -2.4758, -1.8071, -0.8083, -2.2293, -1.9477, -0.0165])
 Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.   | tensor([ 8.4053, -2.2241, -2.7026, -3.0228,  1.0596, -1.4125, -1.6855, -1.3102])
It's not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too. | tensor([ 8.6389, -2.1650, -2.3637, -2.3878, -0.0274, -2.1417, -1.8165, -0.7138])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"   | tensor([ 8.2754, -2.5082, -2.4364, -2.0204, -0.0954, -2.1626, -1.2153, -0.7084])
I'm calling shenanigans. | tensor([ 8.5232, -2.3723, -2.3022, -2.7344,  0.2453, -2.0770, -1.6128, -0.5035])

Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.   | tensor([ 8.5466, -1.9454, -2.4791, -1.9258, -0.5947, -2.2671, -1.1362, -1.0441])
It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n4 - | tensor([ 8.1538, -1.7213, -2.6430, -2.0084, -0.0180, -2.0809, -1.7526, -0.8233])
Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort. | tensor([ 8.0949, -1.7879, -2.7143, -0.7799, -0.4918, -2.9262, -1.3507, -0.8174])

They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead. | tensor([ 4.2276,  0.1476, -1.5710, -0.2215, -0.1854, -0.1743, -2.0958, -0.4118])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\"   | tensor([ 5.2175, -0.8901, -3.1715,  1.9577, -0.0466, -2.3949, -2.2550, -0.1070])
Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out. | tensor([ 7.8457, -1.6043, -2.6523, -0.7458, -0.8245, -1.9593, -2.1717, -0.2812])

Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings. | tensor([ 5.1917, -1.3560, -2.3415,  2.0843, -2.6241, -1.5171, -0.4814, -0.7979])
I love the Improv. | tensor([ 8.3584, -2.1468, -2.4509, -1.9865, -0.5769, -1.7497, -1.9611, -0.1676])
I think its a great way to start or spend a night! | tensor([ 7.9388e+00, -2.2333e+00, -1.6635e+00, -1.7363e+00, -4.0627e-01,
        -1.8752e+00, -2.4568e+00, -1.1814e-03])
Nothing like a laughter filled night. | tensor([ 8.3145, -1.5817, -1.9463, -2.1105, -1.2462, -2.1817, -2.2184,  0.5452])
I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\n\nThings you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. | tensor([ 7.8493, -1.5837, -2.6399, -0.0213, -0.9841, -2.4268, -1.6643, -0.9392])
I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. | tensor([ 8.6852, -2.3207, -1.9228, -2.5514, -0.4077, -1.9942, -1.6723, -0.8719])
Their service is spotty\n\nThe wait staff is a little iffy. | tensor([ 6.6548, -1.0084, -2.5121, -0.5397, -1.0359, -1.9677, -0.0977, -1.6837])
I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. | tensor([ 6.0136, -2.7005,  0.8568, -1.6853, -1.3282, -0.6665, -2.3543, -0.4183])
Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. | tensor([ 2.1164, -1.2930, -2.9764, -1.7631,  7.8456, -1.9856, -1.7999, -0.6611])
Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. | tensor([ 8.5427, -2.0866, -2.0856, -2.5394, -0.4336, -1.3899, -1.5705, -1.3127])
If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it | tensor([ 7.3152, -1.5986, -2.9891, -2.6784,  3.3039, -1.9786, -3.0002, -0.2175])
but this time I was like no way!\n\np.s. | tensor([ 8.1524, -2.2586, -1.7426, -2.6639, -0.3353, -0.2662, -2.3844, -0.6706])
when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble | tensor([ 1.2546, -1.7615,  0.8433, -1.9666, -2.7059,  0.9169, -1.2315,  4.1436])
My husband and I went to do something fun. | tensor([ 5.0405, -1.9475, -2.1588, -3.0074,  3.1160, -0.7818, -2.8029,  0.8843])
The comedy was great! | tensor([ 8.4834, -1.8996, -2.1185, -2.4850, -0.3325, -1.7628, -2.3857, -0.1598])

The food, however, is mediocre at best. | tensor([ 8.2128, -2.0753, -1.2468, -1.5576, -1.5016, -1.1843, -1.9331, -1.2884])
In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. | tensor([ 8.4204, -2.4895, -1.8963, -2.5668, -0.9356, -1.7581, -0.8879, -0.7826])
I could not see a thing. | tensor([ 8.5412, -2.2114, -1.1434, -2.0844, -1.0315, -1.6487, -2.1519, -0.6190])
When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification. | tensor([ 8.4472, -2.4726, -1.8030, -2.6480, -0.7549, -1.9342, -0.8859, -1.1211])

I will not be returning anytime soon. | tensor([ 8.6387, -2.2240, -1.7144, -2.8053, -0.5612, -1.2751, -2.0018, -0.8669])
We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. | tensor([ 8.3540, -2.1518, -2.0883, -2.2108, -0.5423, -2.0483, -2.3016,  0.3696])
We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. | tensor([ 8.3439e+00, -2.4028e+00, -2.4003e+00, -2.4343e+00,  3.6183e-03,
        -1.6281e+00, -1.9700e+00, -5.2626e-01])
Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. | tensor([ 2.3541,  0.9890, -2.0321,  1.0088,  0.8579,  1.5824, -2.2359, -1.6176])
I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. | tensor([ 8.5831, -1.6446, -2.2768, -2.2967, -0.7118, -2.4203, -1.5147, -0.5847])
Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. | tensor([ 7.5755, -1.9004, -2.6210, -2.4835,  1.0353, -1.1221, -2.1933, -1.0509])
It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. | tensor([ 6.9873, -1.2580, -1.5427, -1.4178, -0.7824, -2.0347, -1.9812, -0.0243])
It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. | tensor([ 7.9611, -1.7154, -1.9207, -2.4868, -0.7182, -0.4161, -2.0778, -0.8469])
The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. | tensor([ 6.2507, -1.5575, -2.4739, -1.9320,  2.0854, -1.1004, -1.9028, -1.0972])
I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. | tensor([ 7.3072, -1.8351, -2.2720, -2.4767,  0.2839, -1.0728, -2.0888, -0.5668])
I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. | tensor([ 6.1267, -2.4598,  2.1937, -1.8953, -3.0397, -1.7176, -1.3715, -0.5862])
I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. | tensor([ 8.6664, -2.0608, -1.9628, -2.7308, -0.6030, -1.9413, -1.5719, -0.7463])
For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. | tensor([ 1.0630, -1.8099, -2.0804, -2.3880,  7.9714, -1.4917, -2.3394,  0.6969])
The chocolate cake had freezer burn. | tensor([ 8.1956, -1.8771, -2.4571, -2.8298,  0.2714, -1.8139, -2.1703, -0.1394])
It wasn't edible. | tensor([ 8.4449, -2.0514, -2.0907, -2.6841, -0.4244, -1.7390, -1.8338, -0.5502])

I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. | tensor([ 8.6195, -2.2555, -1.9861, -1.9056, -0.7047, -1.9730, -1.4650, -1.3038])

\n\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. | tensor([ 7.9948, -0.9375, -2.7905, -0.9979, -0.2347, -3.2182, -1.5874, -0.4521])

Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.   | tensor([ 8.4654, -1.7998, -1.9914, -1.3642, -1.2979, -2.7759, -1.6617, -0.1690])

My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.   | tensor([ 8.4117, -1.6910, -1.7797, -2.3311, -1.2484, -1.8686, -2.0025, -0.1835])

My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).   | tensor([ 4.7451, -1.6029, -2.3834,  2.6742, -2.0399, -3.0913, -0.0525, -0.4002])

First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. | tensor([ 8.3874, -1.7667, -2.2880, -1.8347, -0.9851, -2.5074, -1.9496,  0.3400])

\n\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier). | tensor([ 8.5657, -1.7635, -2.2395, -2.8341, -0.5485, -1.6581, -1.5284, -0.7726])

This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. | tensor([ 8.3927, -1.5798, -1.9803, -1.9014, -1.0680, -1.8966, -2.1384, -0.1869])

 \n\nThey did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it. | tensor([ 6.3756, -0.1597, -1.6812, -1.2555, -0.7265,  0.3585, -2.0378, -1.6322])

oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). | tensor([ 7.8278, -1.2960, -1.1652, -1.2101, -1.7863, -2.4135, -2.7167,  0.2999])
the location is clean and the staff are friendly. | tensor([ 8.6926, -2.3204, -2.3182, -2.7297, -0.4528, -1.4115, -1.3838, -0.9837])

i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. | tensor([ 1.7634,  3.8162, -2.3538, -0.1420, -3.4960,  2.2808,  0.9870, -1.1039])
but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like. | tensor([ 3.2740,  0.2882, -2.0901, -3.5405,  0.4898,  0.6484, -1.5925,  2.4930])

You get an extra star for being a pretty Giant Eagle and a Cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles. | tensor([ 7.2087,  0.4986, -2.8086, -1.4458, -0.3716, -2.6434, -2.5450,  0.0820])
Even though the Giant Eagle in Robinson is better in my opinion you, Waterfront Giant Eagle, are not bad and pretty close to where I live. | tensor([ 8.5971, -1.8366, -1.9476, -2.5660, -1.0419, -1.3370, -2.0651, -0.4358])

I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better). | tensor([ 7.6967, -1.7764, -2.7372, -2.9394,  0.8617, -1.8783, -2.6027,  0.8795])

I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger. | tensor([ 8.3196, -1.2653, -2.8832, -3.4641,  0.4501, -1.5611, -1.8177, -0.1502])

The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins. | tensor([ 0.6097, -1.3343, -1.9592, -3.3809,  7.8270, -0.9943, -1.0547,  0.0339])
 Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again. | tensor([ 4.9318, -1.9269, -2.8081, -3.2145,  5.3352, -0.6957, -2.4986, -0.4348])

The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 8.3713, -1.4860, -2.1496, -1.8305, -1.3236, -2.5548, -2.0127,  0.3995])

I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one. | tensor([ 8.4726, -1.4630, -2.2245, -2.5685, -1.0277, -1.5236, -2.2478, -0.0842])

Maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\n\nThe selection is typical for any GE, broad and expansive.   | tensor([ 7.6309, -0.3669, -3.1024, -0.8657, -0.9124, -2.7973, -1.2353, -0.9333])
Some prices are a bit steep. | tensor([ 8.0119, -1.6280, -1.8540, -2.5906, -1.2124, -0.5102, -1.9273, -0.7850])
 \n\nThis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area. | tensor([ 8.3512, -2.3904, -1.8929, -2.4303, -0.5236, -1.3994, -2.1219, -0.4666])

Which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store. | tensor([ 6.5139, -2.4874, -1.7054, -1.9916, -0.9306,  0.0609, -1.6063,  0.3699])
One comfy seat in the entire place, but they have a cafe, they have good books to look at, and they are open until 11pm. | tensor([ 7.2745, -0.8252, -2.4803,  0.1645, -1.4871, -2.1629, -2.3839, -0.3395])

The extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable. | tensor([ 8.4440, -1.9261, -2.1446, -1.6559, -0.9672, -1.6715, -2.1113, -0.7370])
Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores. | tensor([ 4.0557,  1.7531, -2.7428, -1.6409, -2.0754, -0.2687, -0.3476,  1.0192])

Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike. | tensor([ 8.4412, -1.7649, -1.9828, -2.4342, -1.0828, -1.4399, -2.0738, -0.3525])

With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out. | tensor([ 8.2769, -2.1341, -2.2364, -0.8355, -1.0802, -2.2335, -1.8080, -0.6801])

Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\n\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this. | tensor([ 8.2805, -2.1294, -1.5514, -1.4417, -1.6530, -1.8624, -1.1993, -0.8785])

The prices are also fair and often have great discounts. | tensor([ 8.3257, -2.0551, -2.2221, -2.3861, -0.4693, -1.2608, -1.7982, -0.9063])
I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. | tensor([ 8.6389, -2.3607, -1.9893, -2.3593, -0.3539, -2.3743, -1.5622, -0.4329])

but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar. | tensor([ 7.6958, -0.5424, -1.8540, -2.1032, -1.5902, -1.5228, -1.8819, -0.0542])

Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.\n\nSo amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. | tensor([ 8.4566, -2.3225, -2.1987, -1.4570, -0.8844, -2.0985, -1.4607, -0.7669])

I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. | tensor([ 8.6238, -2.1391, -2.0659, -2.2292, -0.6220, -1.8643, -1.9738, -0.3310])

That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. | tensor([ 7.9458e+00, -7.6366e-01, -2.6707e+00, -1.2675e+00, -1.2307e+00,

Staying at the Sheraton here I've patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time, without exception. | tensor([ 8.4674, -2.1630, -1.9607, -2.0998, -1.2583, -2.1570, -1.7104,  0.0197])

Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater. | tensor([ 6.3049, -1.8591, -1.7613,  1.3495, -2.4884, -2.5984, -1.9722,  1.2795])

Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice. | tensor([ 8.6215, -1.9101, -2.5532, -2.4221,  0.1147, -2.5140, -1.9885, -0.0787])

It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.   | tensor([ 8.3078, -2.1442, -1.9602, -1.8856, -0.7824, -1.3395, -2.0064, -0.7124])
We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar. | tensor([ 8.5993, -2.2397, -2.5431, -2.1100,  0.1750, -1.9527, -1.9815, -0.7317])

I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light. | tensor([ 8.5385, -1.8761, -2.2157, -2.6442, -0.2813, -2.1398, -1.9312, -0.3675])
 Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles. | tensor([ 8.0738, -1.7245, -1.6304, -1.4552, -1.1912, -2.0174, -2.0727, -0.4957])

I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours. | tensor([ 8.5756, -1.9049, -2.2984, -2.2658, -0.3318, -2.1508, -2.1189, -0.4809])

The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender. | tensor([ 6.9099, -2.2750, -2.5179, -0.8019,  1.6721, -0.9747, -3.0405, -0.6345])

I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign. | tensor([ 8.2673, -1.1230, -2.2172, -2.8152,  0.1522, -2.1021, -2.5820,  0.3487])

We started with the chips and salsa. | tensor([ 3.6193, -2.9559, -0.6988, -1.2070,  1.6958,  0.7926, -2.1074, -0.3326])

The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup. | tensor([ 8.4931, -2.1906, -2.1490, -2.4040, -0.3925, -0.7658, -2.1021, -1.1066])

Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders. | tensor([ 8.2330, -2.0623, -2.1971, -2.1281, -0.1304, -1.6914, -2.0315, -0.9168])

I guess  the bun was warm | tensor([ 7.4449, -0.1153, -2.5406, -3.6540,  0.0384, -1.1736, -3.0083,  1.3573])
and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.   | tensor([ 6.1142, -1.3740, -1.1439, -1.5669,  1.9101, -0.8529, -3.3199, -1.3594])
He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.   | tensor([ 4.1620,  2.0704, -0.6964, -0.6382, -3.2720, -0.7172,  0.3082, -1.5355])
This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too. | tensor([ 8.6135, -1.7470, -2.2928, -2.3678, -0.6270, -2.2683, -2.2118,  0.1795])

They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service. | tensor([ 8.6493, -1.9885, -2.0988, -2.5225, -0.6329, -1.7740, -1.9152, -0.6675])

Maybe I'm being too critical... | tensor([ 8.6620, -2.1827, -2.2512, -2.4215, -0.4382, -2.0822, -1.5401, -0.6693])

This was surprisingly pretty good.   | tensor([ 8.6526, -2.0166, -2.1743, -2.5239, -0.0561, -1.9746, -2.1255, -0.6644])
The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.   | tensor([ 6.4517, -2.9170, -0.6112, -3.1121,  0.6256,  1.4638, -2.7324, -1.1656])
It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here. | tensor([ 8.5134, -1.8795, -2.1091, -1.9342, -1.1400, -1.6525, -1.9259, -0.6879])

Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.   | tensor([ 8.3871, -1.1749, -2.4852, -2.5040, -0.6506, -1.8527, -2.0849, -0.0999])

If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse. | tensor([ 6.6457, -1.1121, -2.7231,  0.7436, -1.4159, -3.1713, -2.3649,  0.8711])
An absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. | tensor([ 8.4126, -1.7741, -2.6407, -1.6927, -0.6571, -2.5187, -1.8777,  0.0376])
However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. | tensor([ 6.6712, -1.8598, -2.8402,  2.2369, -1.0262, -2.0098, -1.9442, -1.1419])
No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.\n\nAnyway, the small plates made for good \"upscale\" bar food. | tensor([ 6.9666, -1.8300, -3.3015, -1.2091,  1.4357, -1.3522, -2.2085, -0.9120])
Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. | tensor([ 8.3674, -1.7537, -2.8176, -1.8312, -0.2497, -2.2000, -1.8199, -0.3010])
However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. | tensor([ 8.6400, -2.3288, -1.8433, -2.4307, -0.3988, -1.8053, -1.9764, -0.7055])

The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right | tensor([ 2.0174, -0.9960, -0.8862, -1.3376,  1.6443,  2.7778, -3.0752, -0.0336])
but the sauces didn't match up exactly.\n\nBe warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. | tensor([ 1.5507,  0.6639, -2.3733, -0.1352, -0.7937, -1.3974,  5.1665, -3.4803])

The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...  \nLovely for loud large groups\nVaried menu with some original items\nGreat place to watch a game inside with a huge bar\nFun location\nGood place to take out of towners.\n\nThe Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great. | tensor([ 8.1903, -1.1707, -2.8555, -1.9836, -0.6827, -1.6651, -2.0953, -0.1824])

We got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of \"lots of things\"  (Tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.) | tensor([ 2.8676, -0.0280, -3.2693, -0.2824,  4.9091, -2.3986, -1.0036, -0.9940])

I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. | tensor([ 8.4564, -2.2092, -2.3021, -1.3446, -0.8466, -2.2433, -1.7267, -0.4289])
The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. | tensor([ 2.0899, -2.4799, -2.0163, -2.2188,  7.7525, -1.5008, -2.3236, -0.5204])

Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. | tensor([ 7.9981, -2.5684, -2.2190, -1.6364,  0.4646, -2.1660, -1.6740, -1.0876])
This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by... | tensor([ 2.3133, -1.0097,  3.1698, -0.7698, -3.8851, -0.8145, -0.6290, -0.3250])
we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. | tensor([ 0.2796, -2.2850, -2.1217, -0.6696,  7.1347, -1.5354, -2.4757,  0.7364])
She said our food would be out in a few minutes. | tensor([ 5.8581, -2.1295, -1.3185, -1.8599,  1.2178, -0.7966, -1.8210, -1.4080])
Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. | tensor([ 5.5361, -2.6209, -1.2550, -2.6072,  2.1391, -0.8410, -1.3982, -1.5028])
We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. | tensor([ 1.5033, -2.2174, -1.8870, -1.8210,  7.5054, -0.8753, -2.2218, -0.6171])
She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. | tensor([ 8.3326, -1.9617, -2.2974, -2.5822,  0.8912, -2.4343, -1.9894, -0.3096])
She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). | tensor([ 7.4947, -1.5743, -2.2802, -1.4409,  0.6993, -2.4612, -1.8928, -0.8090])
After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? | tensor([ 3.5275, -1.5441, -2.7594, -2.2636,  6.5938, -2.7088, -0.6732, -0.7580])
Seriously?\n\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. | tensor([-0.0323,  0.2480, -0.2105,  0.7443,  2.3497, -2.6518,  0.9852, -2.1607])
10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. | tensor([ 3.2926, -3.1398,  0.3524, -1.4089, -0.0670,  0.1715,  0.4976, -2.3146])
All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. | tensor([ 8.2938, -1.8389, -2.2625, -2.5613, -0.5045, -1.5843, -1.9870, -0.4612])

We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. | tensor([ 8.0689, -1.3508, -2.2024, -1.4185, -1.4875, -2.5634, -1.6991, -0.0775])

I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. | tensor([ 8.4508, -1.7427, -2.0952, -2.6546, -0.5741, -1.8732, -1.9782, -0.0173])
Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. | tensor([ 8.5292, -2.2948, -1.6883, -2.5111, -0.9267, -1.6300, -1.7635, -0.6221])
That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. | tensor([ 6.2659, -0.5909, -3.1180, -1.5194,  1.8276, -1.0176, -3.2704, -0.3930])
I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. | tensor([ 5.0162, -3.0043,  2.9927, -2.5009, -2.4883,  0.9385, -2.7195, -0.3777])

Service has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\n\nThings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon) | tensor([ 3.0511, -3.6778,  3.2633, -2.3343, -2.7256,  3.2768, -1.1272, -1.7051])
Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\n\nRemember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? | tensor([ 8.3155, -1.6099, -2.1718, -2.0531, -0.9191, -1.8444, -2.2867, -0.1614])
Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. | tensor([ 8.5086, -2.2411, -1.1361, -2.2811, -1.4988, -1.4480, -2.0633, -0.4464])

I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\n\n2. | tensor([ 8.5985, -1.5531, -2.7306, -2.3637,  0.0404, -2.2008, -1.6350, -0.7312])

I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\n\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. | tensor([ 8.3582, -2.1200, -2.0976, -1.8811, -0.9163, -2.4275, -1.8438,  0.2491])
I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. | tensor([ 8.4656, -1.3896, -2.2944, -2.0143, -1.0743, -2.0546, -2.2054, -0.0152])

Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here, this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at, when I am in the Homestead water front. | tensor([ 8.5732, -2.4068, -2.0859, -2.6708, -0.4975, -1.8564, -1.3525, -0.7267])
On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. | tensor([ 0.9740, -1.8752,  1.2193, -2.5893, -1.6042,  6.2303, -2.6606,  0.1069])

I've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp, and the accompanying sauces. | tensor([ 0.7685, -1.7816, -1.0491, -2.1314,  3.3586,  3.3764, -3.0872,  0.6932])

So this resturant has sentimental value to me. | tensor([ 8.5178, -2.3943, -2.0000, -2.0853, -0.4495, -2.2265, -1.5626, -0.7824])
I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront. | tensor([ 8.4083, -2.5171, -1.8652, -2.4587, -0.6713, -1.4961, -1.7817, -0.4410])

When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\n\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. | tensor([ 7.9850, -1.2507, -2.6228, -1.2148, -0.6241, -1.8471, -1.4843, -1.4397])

Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. | tensor([ 4.6865, -1.2951, -3.3185, -1.8595,  5.9664, -2.8376, -1.8302, -0.6471])
Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. | tensor([ 8.6895, -2.0208, -2.1921, -2.5707, -0.4702, -2.2959, -1.3177, -0.7298])
So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies. | tensor([ 6.9085, -1.5251, -2.1731, -2.8962,  1.8177, -2.3273, -1.4345, -0.9634])
I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. | tensor([ 7.8221, -2.2160, -1.2845, -1.0671, -1.8078, -2.1421, -1.1634, -1.2320])
Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. | tensor([ 8.6878, -2.0961, -2.2476, -2.5616, -0.2748, -2.3731, -1.3873, -0.7027])

After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. | tensor([ 8.3178, -2.1814, -2.4742, -1.7335,  0.3229, -1.9999, -2.1370, -0.6456])
It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. | tensor([ 8.5813, -1.7857, -2.0785, -1.8392, -1.3435, -1.8735, -1.9711, -0.5057])
We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. | tensor([ 8.5773, -1.5979, -2.3211, -2.1627, -0.5735, -2.1367, -2.2367, -0.4336])
You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. | tensor([ 8.6102, -1.7186, -2.4735, -1.6476, -0.3568, -2.3583, -2.1801, -0.4880])
I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out. | tensor([ 8.4012, -2.2864, -2.0101, -2.2349,  0.0301, -1.5214, -1.9993, -1.0821])

There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place! | tensor([ 0.0465, -0.4283,  0.1536, -2.8306, -0.6255, -0.7875, -1.4696,  5.4502])

Nice, lively place, nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall.\nDrinks are good, service is good.\nLocation is great as well, right across the movie theater. | tensor([ 8.3426, -2.2015, -2.6015, -1.9350, -0.4499, -1.5816, -1.8302, -0.6012])

As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.   | tensor([ 8.3752, -1.2319, -1.3907, -2.7125, -1.8318, -1.1225, -2.2909, -0.1213])
In addition, their drinks are expensive! | tensor([ 8.2575, -1.6604, -2.2716, -2.0088, -0.5950, -1.6335, -2.3235, -0.6076])

Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.   | tensor([ 8.3432, -1.8865, -2.3948, -2.2044, -0.6298, -2.1614, -1.4295, -0.2899])
Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs. | tensor([ 3.8309, -1.1842, -3.4420, -2.1012,  5.7063, -1.2519, -2.5312,  0.3148])

The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.\n\nSo why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? | tensor([ 8.2611, -1.8395, -2.0961, -1.3301, -0.9084, -1.5272, -1.7400, -1.2568])

patio!\n\nHappy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. | tensor([ 7.0243, -1.8267, -2.5700, -2.7798,  0.4289, -0.4898, -2.0412,  0.1974])
My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. | tensor([ 8.2804, -2.0131, -2.1282, -2.3727, -0.8062, -1.6814, -1.8957, -0.2434])
Not bad!\n\nI ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. | tensor([ 8.0483, -2.2403, -2.5693, -2.1405, -0.1313, -1.0673, -1.5627, -0.8755])

The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.\n\nMy recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times! | tensor([ 8.2783, -1.9764, -2.2269, -0.4837, -1.0509, -2.4720, -1.6806, -0.9428])
This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. | tensor([ 8.4310, -1.8274, -2.2574, -1.5611, -0.8523, -2.1827, -1.8939, -0.4695])

When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. | tensor([ 6.8417, -0.3393, -2.7870, -0.0714, -1.3944, -3.0980, -2.3783,  0.8005])

It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. | tensor([ 8.3894, -1.4173, -1.9424, -2.4524, -1.0990, -1.1801, -1.9725, -0.7839])
For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. | tensor([ 8.2383, -0.9274, -2.7312, -1.8075, -0.4233, -2.8918, -1.6815, -0.3418])
I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous... | tensor([ 5.9044, -0.1571, -2.3956, -1.1211, -1.9129, -0.2975, -2.4482,  1.3094])

The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\". | tensor([ 8.3096, -2.2174, -2.5532, -1.7211,  0.4056, -2.6772, -0.8920, -1.4844])

She comped the drink but we won't be back.\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself. | tensor([ 8.6463, -1.7810, -2.5286, -2.0201, -0.2970, -2.5028, -1.5171, -0.8374])

When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. | tensor([ 8.3654, -1.9524, -2.5825, -1.2268, -0.2121, -2.5198, -2.0189, -0.5438])

I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\n\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \"wowed\" me. | tensor([ 8.1842, -1.5247, -2.7086, -1.7865,  0.5508, -1.8421, -1.9289, -1.3851])
And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. | tensor([ 8.5005, -2.1324, -1.4978, -2.3547, -1.6074, -0.7841, -1.7264, -1.1102])
Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. | tensor([ 8.5303, -2.2612, -2.4198, -1.7341, -0.4695, -2.7361, -1.1154, -0.7456])

Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. | tensor([ 8.5079, -1.7861, -2.4033, -1.7527, -0.9041, -1.7023, -2.0024, -0.6796])

Not cool.\n\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon. | tensor([ 8.3247, -1.9730, -2.1311, -2.3535, -1.4297, -2.0684, -1.5976,  0.5997])

They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. | tensor([ 8.1396, -1.5894, -1.8244, -2.4955, -1.0125, -0.1806, -2.0189, -1.4528])
Yummy!!\nOur server was great and we'll definitely be back. | tensor([ 8.6556, -2.2950, -2.2238, -2.4781, -0.1239, -2.2102, -1.4669, -0.8555])
Great environment at night! | tensor([ 7.6190, -0.3114, -2.3355, -2.7851, -1.4224, -0.8266, -2.5195,  0.3768])
Songs going on very lively!! | tensor([ 8.5916, -2.3758, -1.6994, -1.8316, -0.6254, -2.3423, -1.9070, -0.7130])
The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great. | tensor([ 8.6470, -1.8729, -2.3854, -2.1789, -0.3950, -2.2889, -1.7763, -0.5681])
But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious! | tensor([ 6.3948, -1.2854, -2.8797, -1.9014,  2.0055, -0.4493, -3.3124, -0.2437])
Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads | tensor([ 8.6737, -2.3476, -1.9706, -2.3426, -0.4751, -1.6896, -1.9292, -0.8095])
I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks. | tensor([ 7.8051, -0.2800, -2.6418, -2.3251, -0.3419, -1.9685, -2.6408,  0.4214])

I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year. | tensor([ 7.0126, -1.4845, -0.6550, -2.3857, -2.2564, -1.7895, -3.1773,  2.5778])

But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.   | tensor([ 6.8324, -2.1882, -2.3128, -3.3216, -0.3098,  1.4742, -2.0274, -0.3739])
The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set. | tensor([ 0.5784, -2.3660,  4.1711, -3.1051, -2.4753, -0.7771, -2.2964,  5.1542])

The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in. | tensor([ 1.1726, -3.0289,  3.1618, -1.3383, -2.3387, -0.6594, -0.4500,  1.5953])

Occasionally there's live entertainment.\n\nIt's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill. | tensor([ 6.7071,  0.7186, -2.3351, -3.2126, -1.1317, -1.7176, -1.5853,  1.4684])

Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works. | tensor([ 0.8867, -1.2836, -0.4721, -4.6854, -2.1844,  3.7423,  0.7542,  2.6601])

But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening. | tensor([ 8.3664, -1.8477, -1.7232, -2.9975, -0.8702, -1.2283, -2.4259,  0.0804])

The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side. | tensor([ 8.3936, -1.9734, -0.8601, -2.8671, -0.8264, -1.9867, -2.2374, -0.5059])

There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\n\nI'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back. | tensor([ 8.2652, -2.0663, -0.7014, -2.0463, -1.8478, -1.0546, -2.4887, -0.7146])
It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. | tensor([ 7.9767, -1.1765, -1.7094, -1.7834, -2.6413, -1.2524, -2.3175,  0.7058])
The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. | tensor([ 7.3410, -0.9126, -2.8243, -0.6487, -1.4096, -2.4378, -2.2485,  1.2436])
The lazy river could be much better. | tensor([ 2.3973, -0.5720,  2.9898, -1.7699, -3.8501,  0.8581, -0.7240, -0.3185])
I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location. | tensor([ 4.3445, -0.0896, -1.7333, -3.2323, -2.5550,  0.5315, -1.1310,  2.2327])
Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos. | tensor([ 8.4112, -1.7815, -2.0709, -2.1978, -1.2579, -2.2751, -2.0912,  0.4078])

On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \"riders\", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood. | tensor([ 6.9202,  0.7162, -2.7328, -1.6256, -1.8827, -2.7518, -2.4426,  2.0828])
 \n\nUnfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about \"censoring\" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\n\nHaving said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . | tensor([ 7.3496, -0.1040, -3.1870, -0.4758, -1.3049, -2.4375, -2.1650,  0.4510])
cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . | tensor([ 6.1827,  0.7888, -2.3609, -1.7937, -1.2949, -2.1435, -3.0015,  2.0982])
\n\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park. | tensor([ 8.2988, -1.8079, -2.1941, -1.7564, -1.4204, -2.2439, -2.0418,  0.5955])

It is NOT policed particularly effectively. | tensor([ 8.4949, -2.6166, -1.8004, -2.6661, -0.6474, -1.0409, -1.6024, -1.0784])
 if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, \"accidentally\" bumping into people for a reaction from their group. | tensor([ 2.4874,  5.0541, -2.5299, -1.6371,  1.3158, -2.4413, -2.6269,  1.6291])
 \n\nMOSTLY | tensor([ 8.0202, -2.4315, -2.3204, -2.5698,  0.2455, -0.5313, -1.9264, -1.0023])
it's a good time. | tensor([ 8.4477, -2.3221, -2.0319, -2.7247, -0.0382, -1.5317, -1.9275, -0.7627])

So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). | tensor([ 7.0578,  0.5881, -2.8919, -0.5596, -1.5183, -3.1677, -3.0904,  1.9793])
Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. | tensor([ 2.7711, -1.6847, -1.7069, -1.5297, -1.6289, -0.8720, -2.4235,  6.2587])
Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. | tensor([ 8.1225, -1.0322, -2.6157, -1.9536, -1.1497, -2.5425, -2.4010,  1.2985])
Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. | tensor([ 8.4093, -0.6322, -2.5671, -2.0368, -0.9869, -2.7241, -2.3212,  0.6147])
Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! | tensor([ 8.6798, -2.0499, -2.3559, -2.5132,  0.1150, -1.7907, -1.9565, -0.9875])
I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! | tensor([ 6.3634, -1.1467, -1.5904, -3.2699, -2.0915,  2.5602, -2.3081, -0.4174])
I feel like such a big girl now! | tensor([ 5.8890,  1.6525, -2.9193, -3.1209,  2.5056, -1.9743, -2.5064, -0.1880])
Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. | tensor([ 8.5019, -1.6054, -2.4304, -1.5864, -1.0585, -2.4655, -1.0864, -0.8796])
The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. | tensor([ 8.6299, -1.5786, -2.0975, -1.8264, -0.8455, -2.5391, -2.0807, -0.4668])
I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. | tensor([ 8.3015, -1.1162, -2.4826, -1.4486, -0.9930, -2.5485, -1.8468, -0.1483])
\n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. | tensor([ 6.6585,  0.1898, -2.7660, -0.4784, -1.3334, -3.5042, -1.8591,  1.0912])
It was weird. | tensor([ 8.5196, -2.3036, -1.7260, -2.1971, -0.5740, -1.6367, -2.2767, -0.5799])
Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. | tensor([ 1.2147, -0.5326, -2.4543, -3.2733,  1.1723,  0.7149,  1.9706,  0.0811])
Although it was still fun. | tensor([ 8.5959, -1.8533, -2.1942, -2.5080, -0.3155, -1.7665, -2.4805, -0.2046])
The last dude threw me in backwards! | tensor([ 8.5800, -1.4974, -2.4910, -2.3615, -0.1126, -2.4844, -2.3265,  0.1274])
Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. | tensor([ 8.4234e+00, -1.5874e+00, -2.2617e+00, -2.3307e+00, -9.6309e-01,

Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. | tensor([ 6.4347,  0.6902, -3.0977, -3.1530,  2.5283, -1.4426, -2.7754, -0.0892])

\n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. | tensor([ 8.3933, -2.0788, -1.6229, -2.4822, -0.7217, -1.3680, -2.5829, -0.3512])
It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. | tensor([ 7.6498, -0.7369, -2.4351, -1.3266, -1.6434, -1.5066, -2.2810,  0.2903])
By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! | tensor([ 8.2638, -0.9682, -2.1676, -2.7051, -0.3581, -2.2461, -2.7490,  0.5343])
So the lines weren't long at all. | tensor([ 8.5650, -2.5493, -2.3029, -2.4511,  0.0299, -1.9546, -1.2398, -1.1998])
Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. | tensor([ 8.2969, -1.9805, -2.1203, -1.7204, -0.9630, -1.7233, -1.4587, -0.9056])
You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. | tensor([ 0.2851,  1.6946, -0.6192, -2.7212, -1.1143, -0.6836, -0.8730,  4.3987])
Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. | tensor([ 6.2300, -0.9390, -1.1936, -2.7611, -1.6062,  0.0292, -2.0752,  0.8635])
Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. | tensor([ 7.8498, -0.3111, -1.9389, -2.4136, -1.4466, -2.0826, -2.0143,  0.2816])
Now go off and have some fun! :) | tensor([ 8.5212, -2.6846, -2.0834, -2.4276, -0.2881, -1.3181, -1.6171, -1.1488])
so it's not as fun as kennywood | tensor([ 7.5366, -1.4505, -1.1223, -0.6932, -1.6314, -2.7957, -2.6905,  0.3091])
but i guess it's still cool... \n\ni planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby (his first time) it was supposed to be nice day, but the weather changed in 2 weeks.. \n\nwe picked a nice time.. since it was literally supposed to rain all day, there werent any long lines/ we literally rode every water slide in one hour. | tensor([ 8.2394, -0.7762, -2.3865, -1.0212, -1.9608, -2.0420, -1.6551, -0.3501])
then we went to head to the lazy river--- & it was closed! | tensor([ 3.2435, -1.1277,  0.2671, -2.3058, -3.6010,  2.6661, -0.3033,  0.1500])
they said it was closed due to not enough attendence, but i mean come on. | tensor([ 8.6545, -2.4103, -1.9090, -2.3300, -0.4631, -2.1603, -1.5946, -0.6936])
we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour.. | tensor([ 8.2138, -1.2980, -2.2199, -2.5554, -1.9454, -0.5346, -2.1138,  0.0672])
keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour! | tensor([-1.1548, -0.4816,  4.0541, -0.4042, -4.8399,  1.2321,  0.8913,  0.1183])
the cliff hanger was also closed- like always. | tensor([ 8.5064, -1.7740, -2.2785, -2.4865, -0.4027, -2.6593, -1.7820,  0.1309])
\n\nso we just went and rode everything again. | tensor([ 8.4472, -1.9850, -1.5990, -2.0417, -1.6077, -1.1282, -1.8864, -0.7962])
the Dragon's Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well. | tensor([ 6.9478, -1.3430, -2.6785, -3.1144,  0.2258,  0.3421, -2.8637,  0.6063])
bobby had a blast on the speed slides. | tensor([ 8.5227, -1.6615, -2.4120, -2.4131, -0.4839, -1.9073, -2.0709, -0.2286])
i have to admit though, i do miss the regular body slide. | tensor([ 8.6728, -1.9427, -2.3260, -2.4984, -0.5126, -1.7541, -1.8291, -0.6981])
\n\nanother reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days. | tensor([ 8.2809, -1.5207, -2.6416, -1.4896, -0.7486, -2.1346, -2.2495, -0.0670])
well actually at 4:45 we recieved a \"15 minute warning\" that the park was closing at 5 due to rain. | tensor([ 8.4657, -1.7184, -2.3645, -2.0724, -0.8515, -2.5681, -1.5175,  0.0792])
ugh, a little more time would've been helpful. | tensor([ 8.4599, -1.5332, -2.5215, -2.4771, -0.1257, -2.5121, -2.0488,  0.0291])
\n\ni couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under-staffed to stay open until 7. | tensor([ 8.4302, -1.6749, -2.3004, -2.0079, -0.6181, -2.6662, -1.0299, -0.5805])
it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over . | tensor([ 8.4646, -1.6754, -1.5410, -2.9364, -0.7343, -2.0274, -2.2968,  0.3804])
the park could've just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed,  but due to being under-staffed would rather hand out rain checks.. which is fine because we get an another entire day, but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day. | tensor([ 8.4642, -1.5316, -2.3027, -2.1199, -1.5272, -1.9404, -1.6903,  0.1126])
\n\noverall, the smile on my boyfriend's face was priceless, but i truly wish we could've enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7. | tensor([ 8.4873, -1.4811, -2.3108, -2.5911, -0.7575, -2.0144, -2.1928,  0.2474])

Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \"okay\" for me. | tensor([ 3.0596,  0.0962, -2.2571, -2.4070, -0.4914, -2.3155, -2.5138,  6.0693])
I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \"family\" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. | tensor([ 8.3527, -1.2315, -2.3669, -2.2364, -0.7290, -2.3442, -2.1933,  0.0842])
The water slides here were lacking. | tensor([ 8.2770, -1.8902, -1.9120, -2.5800, -1.4232, -0.9926, -1.9393, -0.0257])
There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. | tensor([ 8.5571, -1.6774, -2.0127, -1.5040, -1.3085, -2.0711, -2.0561, -0.3799])
The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. | tensor([ 8.3563, -1.2414, -2.4143, -1.4278, -1.4124, -2.2360, -2.0931,  0.0768])

but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. | tensor([ 7.6299,  0.1956, -2.5749, -2.1918, -1.2883, -0.8596, -2.8753,  0.6716])
The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. | tensor([ 8.2011, -1.5768, -2.0191, -2.6974, -0.7162, -1.5425, -2.4754,  0.5909])

It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. | tensor([ 8.4459, -1.5475, -2.2378, -2.5391, -0.2626, -1.5424, -2.5186, -0.4285])
The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. | tensor([ 8.1156, -0.8514, -2.5936, -3.3115, -0.3895, -1.6654, -2.4495,  0.9230])
I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.\n\nOverall, this place is just mediocre. | tensor([ 5.0590,  0.2881, -2.0471, -0.6996, -4.0247,  1.7695, -1.6113,  0.7209])
It doesn't \"wow\" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun. | tensor([ 2.0686,  2.7010, -3.3514, -1.9149,  3.2584, -0.0063, -2.8658,  1.2976])

Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. | tensor([ 8.2326, -1.0943, -2.5898, -1.0699, -1.4669, -2.7232, -2.1702,  0.4566])

The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. | tensor([ 8.1283, -1.4669, -2.9278, -2.6620, -0.1340, -1.5391, -2.0013,  0.5204])

I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). | tensor([ 7.8634e+00, -5.5932e-01, -2.9995e+00, -2.4549e+00,  7.7763e-04,

You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon. | tensor([ 4.2080,  0.3515, -1.9084, -2.0838,  0.6357, -0.7825, -0.0209, -0.9873])

They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. | tensor([ 8.6064, -1.9304, -2.1045, -2.4601, -0.6117, -2.4648, -1.7086, -0.1616])

It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?   | tensor([ 8.4029, -2.0409, -2.3453, -2.0015, -0.6127, -1.4543, -1.9183, -0.4429])
It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago. | tensor([ 8.5829, -2.3307, -2.1555, -2.1034, -0.9004, -1.8128, -1.2936, -0.8780])

The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. | tensor([ 8.5842, -2.2030, -2.2287, -2.3278, -0.2930, -1.6638, -1.9685, -0.8124])
For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. | tensor([ 8.3634, -1.8401, -2.2966, -2.6188, -0.5606, -1.9407, -1.6812, -0.3919])

If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good. | tensor([ 6.2744, -1.3284, -2.4984,  0.6104, -1.1005, -0.6957, -2.2427, -0.5163])

\n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. | tensor([ 7.6319, -2.0049, -2.5222, -2.6024,  1.3167, -2.6706,  0.1642, -2.0529])

She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. | tensor([ 7.8546, -1.2625, -2.8627, -3.3691,  1.4117, -2.1450, -2.5131,  0.5390])

I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. | tensor([ 8.6900, -2.2359, -2.2434, -2.2259, -0.1071, -2.3681, -1.5686, -0.8456])

I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken | tensor([-0.2835, -2.4828,  0.4996, -2.0971, -1.9612,  8.6231, -1.0413, -0.9705])

The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. | tensor([ 8.2639, -1.5581, -2.1062, -2.1271, -0.7241, -1.0191, -2.4978, -0.6741])

It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. | tensor([ 8.6352, -2.0047, -2.3776, -2.1100, -0.5328, -2.2650, -1.6536, -0.5779])

I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. | tensor([ 8.3410, -1.8302, -2.4122, -2.7406, -0.8254, -1.5308, -1.7389, -0.1849])

I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. | tensor([ 8.5208, -1.9769, -1.9973, -1.8366, -1.0766, -1.8996, -1.7773, -0.6219])

The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. | tensor([ 8.6005, -2.2887, -2.0824, -2.2055, -0.5709, -2.3866, -1.1019, -1.0988])
She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \"okay\", not even a sorry once!!!\nI would not like to go there again... :( | tensor([ 4.4779, -0.4159, -3.7437, -2.2057,  5.2667, -2.3690, -1.9622,  0.7351])

I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. | tensor([ 8.4742, -2.0690, -2.1281, -2.0710, -0.7952, -2.0445, -1.5587, -0.6463])

Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. | tensor([ 8.3529, -1.3685, -2.3534, -2.4339, -1.0104, -1.6590, -1.6810, -0.2484])

Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. | tensor([ 8.0525, -0.7709, -3.2222, -2.9223,  1.5613, -2.3503, -1.1007, -1.3563])
I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. | tensor([ 7.4469, -0.8065, -2.1181, -3.1113, -0.9527, -1.0864, -1.7218, -0.0695])

and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. | tensor([ 8.2756, -1.9156, -2.4429, -2.5105,  0.2007, -1.5328, -2.2149, -0.5214])

But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. | tensor([ 7.8865, -2.0470, -2.6002, -3.0833,  1.6049, -2.1342, -1.8441, -0.4687])

and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \"Soooo, you DON'T want these???\" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. | tensor([ 4.9981, -0.4107, -3.4354, -2.1437,  4.4732, -0.9300, -2.6923, -0.3553])

I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! | tensor([ 7.3760, -2.2047, -3.0503, -3.0954,  2.3999, -1.6057, -2.4099,  0.0968])
that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. | tensor([ 8.1400, -1.8631, -2.6927, -2.9066,  1.2360, -2.5680, -1.8429, -0.0465])

I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). | tensor([ 8.4455, -1.7093, -2.7308, -2.7865,  0.7375, -2.6628, -1.2851, -0.7836])

Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. | tensor([ 8.0742, -2.0441, -1.7503, -2.3551, -1.4880, -1.5295, -1.4904, -0.4341])

The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\n\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. | tensor([ 8.6425, -2.3687, -2.3617, -2.3043, -0.1823, -2.0635, -1.1559, -1.1624])
We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. | tensor([ 8.4872, -1.9057, -2.5177, -2.5837, -0.0954, -2.2297, -0.6317, -1.3311])
They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\n\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. | tensor([-0.4554, -0.7547, -2.8440,  0.1012,  2.3747,  1.4762,  0.7162, -0.0778])
We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. | tensor([ 8.4734, -1.4671, -2.7615, -2.6690, -0.2232, -2.2913, -1.7973,  0.0405])
I saw open tables.\n\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\n\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. | tensor([ 6.8359, -2.3187, -1.2685, -1.1841, -0.8516, -1.4005, -0.1738, -1.9222])

Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\n\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again. | tensor([ 8.3064, -1.1463, -2.8538, -2.5552, -0.2402, -2.2197, -2.0358,  0.3252])

   2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus. | tensor([ 8.3023, -1.6224, -2.4655, -1.6948, -0.8878, -1.7979, -1.5722, -0.9054])

The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. | tensor([ 8.0211, -1.1034, -2.3932, -2.1189, -0.5912, -1.0222, -2.0467, -1.0780])
Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. | tensor([ 8.2035, -1.2865, -2.6678, -1.6737, -1.1684, -2.3922, -1.9955,  0.4353])
The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. | tensor([ 8.4740, -1.6103, -2.7195, -2.2885, -0.3655, -2.1357, -1.6960, -0.2101])

He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. | tensor([ 8.3471, -1.5737, -2.1763, -1.4011, -1.0623, -1.8613, -2.2968, -0.3994])

(not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. | tensor([ 8.4484, -2.2383, -2.2572, -1.3050, -0.9132, -1.9713, -1.6552, -0.9809])
It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. | tensor([ 8.4289, -1.9427, -2.1556, -1.5310, -0.9212, -2.7460, -0.8363, -1.2478])

Definitely not!\n\nIt was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.\n\nThis particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. | tensor([ 6.4319, -2.0284, -3.5464, -2.5224, -0.3736, -1.2268,  1.2696,  0.3501])

Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.\n\nI don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full. | tensor([ 7.8793, -1.6193, -2.8474, -2.2530,  0.7872, -0.5761, -2.3418, -1.1984])

and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. | tensor([ 8.4441, -2.2335, -2.2857, -2.5559,  0.1327, -1.8945, -2.0125, -0.3218])
The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. | tensor([ 6.4134, -1.5681, -2.9056, -0.9780,  2.4178, -1.2877, -2.9146, -0.6825])
It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. | tensor([ 8.4791, -2.1536, -1.9256, -2.4585, -0.3792, -2.0488, -2.1342,  0.0140])
The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. | tensor([ 7.9761, -1.2263, -2.7342, -1.7227,  1.1046, -1.7135, -2.5792, -1.2148])
Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. | tensor([ 8.4415, -2.7118, -1.5302, -2.6969, -0.7388, -0.8556, -1.8524, -1.2727])
\n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. | tensor([ 8.4045, -1.7568, -2.7207, -2.2979,  0.0858, -1.8874, -1.5937, -1.2159])
It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. | tensor([ 8.4339, -1.8746, -2.4948, -2.4845,  0.3224, -2.6294, -0.7972, -1.3633])
I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \"meant to be shared.\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. | tensor([ 1.4752, -1.3889, -2.4092, -2.2474,  7.5850, -0.9653, -2.2254, -0.0604])
Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \"here's your sauce\" kind of way. | tensor([ 4.5339, -2.8486, -1.9039, -2.3832,  4.9708, -1.1968, -2.2398, -1.0376])
I remember thinking, \"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. | tensor([ 6.9244, -1.0798, -2.6329, -0.9732,  1.0212, -2.2092, -2.8284, -0.2988])
Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. | tensor([ 4.8631, -1.2253, -1.9873, -0.8820,  2.1126, -0.3340, -3.5477, -0.4386])
We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. | tensor([ 5.4587,  0.1744, -2.5636, -0.9110,  1.3573, -1.4401, -3.9555,  0.2635])
the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. | tensor([ 8.6664, -2.1727, -2.3182, -2.8878,  0.0954, -1.6485, -1.8493, -0.8494])
For meals that were \"meant to be shared\" these sure are little portions. | tensor([ 7.3466, -0.5213, -2.7074, -1.2968, -1.6682, -2.0869, -2.4072,  1.2034])
I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. | tensor([ 8.2032, -1.2628, -2.5647, -1.8060, -1.0252, -2.4037, -1.9553,  0.2454])
The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). | tensor([ 8.1865, -1.6396, -2.1657, -1.8904, -0.3557, -1.4500, -2.5556, -0.6891])
I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. | tensor([ 8.3430, -1.6002, -1.9992, -2.2498, -0.9029, -1.9136, -2.5919,  0.4160])
I thought the experience was lacking. | tensor([ 8.5718, -2.1099, -2.2459, -2.6062, -0.3341, -1.8610, -1.9027, -0.3168])
P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. | tensor([ 7.2036, -0.1885, -3.5317, -2.0587,  0.1391, -0.7022, -1.5633, -1.2325])
I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. | tensor([ 8.6967, -1.7474, -2.2404, -2.4436, -0.5761, -2.2989, -1.5872, -0.4696])
The music didn't fit the ambiance. | tensor([ 8.4451, -1.9156, -2.3356, -1.8189, -0.3548, -1.6508, -1.9871, -0.7972])
Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. | tensor([ 5.5167, -1.5883, -1.5109, -2.6616,  0.0135, -1.3083,  1.1817, -2.1453])
The restaurant was loud and crowded. | tensor([ 7.9455, -1.0163, -3.0005, -2.5765,  0.9705, -1.0247, -2.8158, -0.7163])
The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...   | tensor([ 5.3099,  2.1027, -2.9576, -1.6252,  1.9238, -1.3033, -1.9204, -1.5426])
\n\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck. | tensor([ 8.4904, -1.8759, -2.4958, -2.6605,  0.0149, -1.6238, -2.1687, -0.5341])
Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight. | tensor([ 8.0669, -1.9930, -2.8182, -2.8824,  0.5518, -1.0874, -2.4963,  0.0899])
  First time at this location. | tensor([ 8.5697, -2.1969, -2.1796, -2.8124, -0.0398, -1.5618, -2.0700, -0.4526])
 Great service, but wasn't hard to do..... | tensor([ 8.6028, -2.2409, -2.1539, -2.9087, -0.3089, -1.6446, -1.7565, -0.6157])
\n\nHad a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice. | tensor([ 4.4362, -1.7254, -0.6067, -1.8212,  0.3543,  2.4034, -2.1368, -1.2801])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
It was typical PF Changs (Very good). | tensor([ 7.6263, -1.3737, -2.7421, -2.4369,  0.0480, -2.2412, -2.2767,  1.1222])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu. | tensor([-2.3825,  3.3841,  1.6314,  0.6646, -2.5463, -2.2612, -1.7762,  4.4138])
Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \n\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. | tensor([ 0.7020, -2.3517, -1.6767, -2.2491,  7.9065, -1.6900, -2.0143,  0.5022])
The apps came out fast and were fantastic. | tensor([ 8.6176, -2.1425, -2.3947, -2.2747, -0.0754, -2.1784, -1.7688, -0.5304])
Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. | tensor([ 6.5770, -1.7740, -2.2686, -3.1058,  1.3354, -2.1377, -2.6816,  1.5284])
The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. | tensor([ 5.4979, -2.7749, -1.2785, -3.4722,  0.7197,  1.4570, -1.4059, -1.1416])
He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. | tensor([ 2.6412, -2.9781, -0.1734, -2.8411, -2.1820,  6.4566, -0.7386, -1.0390])
By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\n\nI ordered the chocolate cake. | tensor([ 4.5008, -2.3079, -2.0927, -2.6986,  1.1917,  3.0841, -1.7319, -1.2324])
I asked for a container to take half home. | tensor([ 4.7845, -2.0932,  1.7376, -3.4069, -2.0193,  0.0942, -2.1878,  1.5943])
The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. | tensor([ 7.7105, -1.0671, -3.0591, -3.0469,  1.9425, -2.2942, -1.6069, -0.8038])
She then realized that a larger one would be better.\n\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total. | tensor([ 2.9912, -0.4898, -2.5135, -1.5691, -1.2704,  1.3949, -1.2611,  2.3106])
ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. | tensor([ 8.5074, -1.9058, -2.0482, -2.0263, -0.7936, -1.5622, -2.3696, -0.6599])
now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. | tensor([ 8.4940, -2.2448, -1.1615, -1.9289, -1.5863, -1.1719, -2.1977, -0.6769])
i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. | tensor([ 8.4178, -1.8713, -2.0212, -2.8698, -0.7062, -1.1241, -1.9803, -0.5926])
then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. | tensor([ 7.1543, -0.4229, -2.5955, -0.3424, -1.0961, -1.4277, -2.7421, -0.1426])
don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. | tensor([ 8.5195, -2.1940, -2.0013, -2.7571, -0.8102, -1.9167, -0.9539, -1.0086])
just saying... | tensor([ 8.2319, -2.5004, -1.9645, -2.8289, -0.1441, -0.7953, -1.7301, -1.0199])
Our last few visits have left something to desire, One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. | tensor([ 8.6283, -2.0595, -2.3020, -2.2433, -0.1827, -2.4858, -1.6693, -0.5402])
These people look miserable, no one smiles or greets | tensor([ 8.6281, -2.2877, -1.6577, -1.7033, -1.1441, -2.3394, -1.2791, -1.2421])
you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\n\nThe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. | tensor([ 8.0390, -2.2195, -1.6916, -1.9126, -1.4197, -1.2118, -1.2343, -1.0995])

and I came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT, HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning. | tensor([ 8.5533, -2.1311, -2.3594, -1.5200, -0.3815, -2.4002, -1.3576, -1.4119])
If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!! | tensor([ 8.6336, -1.8137, -2.5021, -2.1382, -0.2573, -2.6788, -1.4740, -0.2644])

We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. | tensor([ 6.5712, -0.9808, -3.5982, -3.1008,  3.9368, -2.1800, -1.7916, -0.7985])
We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.   | tensor([ 6.9524, -1.7129, -2.9447, -3.3517,  3.8641, -2.3973, -2.1915, -0.2895])
She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. | tensor([ 8.3407, -1.4882, -2.8064, -2.8922,  0.7196, -2.6395, -1.8073,  0.0916])
We ordered appetizers and they never came out.   | tensor([ 8.3070, -1.9439, -2.0781, -2.2159, -0.4344, -2.0201, -2.0464, -0.2543])
She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. | tensor([ 2.9539, -2.4076, -0.3016, -1.7969,  1.8307,  1.2139, -1.3288, -1.4132])
By the way we were the only people at the bar. | tensor([ 8.6886, -2.3784, -2.3072, -2.4065, -0.1129, -2.1492, -1.8393, -0.4261])

Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. | tensor([-0.6602, -2.7149,  0.7755,  0.1796, -1.1003,  1.6143,  1.3325, -0.6984])
We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. | tensor([ 4.8558, -1.9011, -1.2623, -1.1737,  0.8688, -0.8211, -1.0134, -1.7966])
We finally got seated by the windows. | tensor([ 8.4736, -2.1758, -2.0854, -2.1372, -1.0354, -1.7578, -1.7014, -0.4297])
Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. | tensor([ 7.7229, -1.4236, -1.4668, -2.3140, -1.4289, -1.2306, -2.3107,  0.1869])
We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. | tensor([ 8.6636, -2.2923, -2.2689, -2.5666,  0.0903, -2.0782, -1.7771, -0.7279])
After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. | tensor([ 8.6698, -2.5528, -1.6693, -2.2985, -0.7217, -1.7140, -1.6900, -1.0627])

This PF Changs needs new management!! | tensor([ 8.4614, -1.9592, -2.7090, -2.6637,  0.7502, -2.2512, -1.6606, -0.7919])
We will never return. | tensor([ 8.5419, -2.4840, -1.1416, -2.5679, -0.9631, -1.6744, -1.5614, -1.2861])
I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. | tensor([ 8.5940, -1.9839, -2.4267, -2.5387, -0.4206, -2.2307, -0.5554, -1.3794])

It's not worth the headache. | tensor([ 8.6183, -1.9645, -2.3457, -2.2162, -0.5881, -1.9812, -1.8886, -0.4705])

Food isn't the most authentic chinese food we've ever had, hence the 4 stars. | tensor([-0.0619, -2.9505,  1.6840, -2.0884, -1.6814,  7.6013, -2.0627, -0.9362])

Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!   | tensor([ 3.4795, -1.4203, -3.5361, -0.2556,  5.5269, -1.9746, -1.0481, -1.5296])

Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat. | tensor([ 1.2379,  3.1662, -2.6088, -0.5851,  4.6690, -0.8353, -2.8998, -1.0629])

We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. | tensor([ 8.1650, -1.9122, -0.7022, -2.3946, -1.9926, -1.2477, -2.4773, -0.1573])
There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. | tensor([ 8.6642, -2.3341, -2.0553, -2.0671, -0.8502, -1.6339, -1.8252, -0.7666])
As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. | tensor([ 8.3778, -1.4059, -2.7670, -1.8655,  0.3256, -2.0199, -1.9178, -0.9496])

\n\nI still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy. | tensor([ 4.6784,  0.4570, -2.3556, -4.3920, -1.3792,  2.4427,  0.4622, -0.7843])

after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. | tensor([ 7.8633, -2.2253, -1.5031, -1.0735, -0.8482, -1.0371, -2.2265, -1.2725])

After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. | tensor([ 8.2843, -1.5933, -1.6815, -1.3174, -1.0714, -2.1695, -2.3693, -0.6109])
My husband's dish was OK. | tensor([ 8.5522, -2.3576, -2.0397, -2.8459,  0.0793, -1.9216, -1.7063, -0.8017])
then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. | tensor([ 8.2429, -1.4655, -1.7917, -1.8528, -0.9881, -1.1841, -2.2475, -0.8788])
I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. | tensor([ 8.5439, -1.6618, -1.9311, -2.5722, -0.9735, -1.4485, -1.9514, -0.8064])

Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. | tensor([-0.4231, -2.1258,  0.6946, -1.7073, -1.8221,  7.9447, -1.6656, -0.8247])
But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something | tensor([ 8.6119, -2.0114, -2.4374, -2.4843,  0.1487, -2.0143, -2.1626, -0.2645])
I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. | tensor([ 0.0343, -1.9838,  0.4579, -2.1074, -1.8000,  7.5895, -1.9048, -0.1890])
Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. | tensor([-1.1518, -2.5591,  3.1369, -1.4731, -2.8369,  6.8185, -0.9258, -1.0920])
At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) | tensor([ 8.2285, -1.7820, -1.9951, -1.8479, -0.9147, -1.7515, -2.0884, -0.6008])
leafs that covered everything beneath. | tensor([ 7.9699, -2.4063, -1.8044, -2.6897, -0.2054, -1.0890, -1.3659, -0.8936])
In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. | tensor([ 3.5709, -1.4332, -1.9575, -2.4066,  0.2268,  3.6992, -0.4869, -1.6579])
As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! | tensor([ 8.0422, -1.5745, -1.9601, -2.3712, -1.6861, -0.4433, -1.2531, -1.0953])
On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). | tensor([ 8.5708, -1.6226, -2.4772, -2.2038, -0.5781, -1.9036, -1.9808, -0.2873])
\n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. | tensor([ 3.3999,  0.8823, -3.7937, -1.2122,  1.2493, -0.1153,  0.6967, -1.3919])
\n\nOn my plate | tensor([ 7.9798, -1.7240, -3.0759, -3.1793,  2.2411, -1.5044, -1.9161, -1.4437])
I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. | tensor([ 1.9197, -2.5648,  0.2206, -2.1594, -2.2621,  6.9665, -1.2117, -1.6598])
Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. | tensor([ 8.2039, -1.5311, -2.0039, -1.7987, -1.1744, -2.1501, -1.7582, -0.1010])
None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. | tensor([ 5.2336, -0.3649, -2.7075, -2.0743, -1.8486, -0.7538, -2.5763,  4.1054])
Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! | tensor([ 6.2607, -3.3446, -1.1673, -3.4857, -0.6773,  0.9217,  0.7161, -2.0104])

The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. | tensor([ 6.0626, -1.5534, -3.1400, -1.2074,  1.3880, -0.2476, -0.9706, -2.0332])

The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. | tensor([ 8.4661, -1.9065, -1.6168, -2.4655, -0.8472, -1.3688, -2.2663, -0.4949])
Had a strange texture. | tensor([ 7.6227, -1.7690, -2.0991, -2.9983, -0.5381,  0.8853, -2.2719, -0.7885])
Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. | tensor([ 7.5477, -1.9822, -2.0088, -3.1521,  0.3688,  0.6155, -2.0956, -1.4359])

But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. | tensor([ 3.3056, -2.4208,  0.2125, -0.8603, -0.6464,  0.1369,  0.5943, -2.1121])

When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back. | tensor([ 8.3365, -1.9988, -1.4548, -2.2494, -1.2917, -1.3494, -1.6771, -1.0196])

They just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. | tensor([ 8.1573, -1.7709, -2.0295, -1.3955, -1.3587, -0.9650, -2.0344, -1.0696])

It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. | tensor([ 3.2615, -1.4542, -2.7164, -3.0287,  7.3160, -1.9002, -2.4510,  0.6645])
\n\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse. | tensor([ 8.5059, -1.9392, -2.6260, -2.0105,  0.3167, -2.3907, -1.9465, -0.5341])
I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from Panera employees. | tensor([ 8.5873, -2.1465, -1.7977, -2.6503, -1.1159, -1.7716, -0.9686, -1.1865])

Overall, I had a good first visit and definitely going back.\n\nThe only thing that made it didn't earn a five-star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm.   | tensor([ 8.6602, -2.2080, -2.0632, -2.3472, -0.5341, -2.1131, -1.5116, -0.7079])

The vet didn't mentioned it during the \"exam\" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.\n\nI was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination. | tensor([ 7.2738, -1.1432, -2.9638, -0.9079, -1.2427, -2.8512, -1.9348,  1.1866])

You just need to know what to buy there, and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spot.\n\nBeware -- though their merchandise looks nice, and it's a good buy for a student, you don't want to make long-term purchases here. | tensor([ 8.0010, -2.4057, -0.9047, -2.1816, -2.2411, -1.5311, -0.6666, -0.6320])

I've heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash.\n\nThat said, their store-brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap, and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS. | tensor([ 4.0753,  0.4959, -3.1310, -0.4873, -1.4791, -2.4240,  0.0520,  1.7877])
They also have a cool program with Flickr.com -- you can upload your photos, order them online from Target's One-Hour Photo kiosk, and pay by credit card when you pick them up.\n\nI love their cheap accessories -- glasses, bags, jewelry. | tensor([ 7.9209, -1.3933, -2.6629, -2.8686,  0.4487, -1.7485, -2.2759, -0.1535])

He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.\n\nMe, I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.   | tensor([ 8.0064, -1.6645, -2.3280, -1.8606, -1.1575, -1.4906, -2.3788,  0.3434])

\n\nIn addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. | tensor([ 7.3577, -1.5403, -2.5804, -2.2738, -0.4045, -2.5557, -2.0265,  1.8500])
Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. | tensor([ 8.0363, -1.6851, -2.5569, -1.8202, -0.8002, -2.1361, -2.1504,  0.6361])
I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service. | tensor([ 8.5503, -2.3192, -2.1639, -2.1686, -0.5088, -1.8978, -1.8334, -0.5239])
It's not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs.\n\nIf you're looking for produce, lower prices, and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty. | tensor([ 8.0576, -1.8571, -2.2773, -2.5366, -1.3172, -0.9761, -1.7015,  0.1511])

Children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. | tensor([ 8.1575, -1.2600, -2.4838, -2.3826, -0.2329, -1.8260, -2.3271, -0.2464])

and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- | tensor([ 6.6494, -1.6611, -2.8914, -3.0147, -1.0892,  0.1428, -0.6148,  0.4873])
When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \"Oh... | tensor([ 3.9688, -1.5693, -2.9116, -3.1876,  6.0966, -0.9933, -2.7051,  0.4694])
I don't know\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \"Let me check that for you\") he instead said \"Well, I'm going to hang up now.\"   | tensor([ 8.3530, -2.4832, -2.0289, -1.4983, -0.6352, -2.1899, -1.4257, -0.9556])
And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- | tensor([ 7.6147, -1.1369, -2.5509, -3.2738,  1.1005, -1.7838, -2.3605, -0.2232])
We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know. | tensor([ 8.5870, -1.9658, -2.2541, -2.4708, -0.1844, -2.5990, -1.5807, -0.4470])

We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \"I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\" to which she responded \"Yeah that should be fine\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- | tensor([ 3.9540, -1.1943, -3.2245, -2.9782,  6.0145, -1.2115, -1.9325,  0.0523])
My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- | tensor([ 8.5334, -1.8679, -2.5362, -2.5058, -0.0673, -2.5600, -1.7663,  0.1873])
As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse. | tensor([ 5.0656, -2.4587, -2.7150, -2.6824,  3.9434,  0.0348, -2.2541, -0.6236])

Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it. | tensor([ 8.6865, -2.0808, -2.1075, -2.7667, -0.2826, -2.3552, -1.6028, -0.4861])

The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion. | tensor([ 8.1386, -2.3431, -2.5869, -2.6682,  0.8367, -1.5628, -1.8919, -0.6505])

When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use. | tensor([ 8.2607, -2.7475, -2.0609, -2.1281, -0.4479, -1.7623, -0.4988, -1.4584])

Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \"Effing Men's Wearhouse.\"   | tensor([ 6.3944, -2.0799, -3.4270, -3.0152,  4.0022, -1.7319, -2.0713,  0.1670])

Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. | tensor([ 8.4493, -1.5602, -2.6037, -2.8511, -0.2255, -2.1287, -1.9852,  0.2578])

The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. | tensor([ 7.9517, -0.9224, -2.1943, -3.9885, -0.8750, -1.2498, -1.6708,  0.3789])

Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. | tensor([ 4.2676, -1.1633, -0.8389, -1.6952,  1.2705, -2.2817, -2.1752,  0.7940])
Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? | tensor([ 3.2717,  3.7377, -1.4914, -3.0580, -1.2387, -3.0519, -2.1552,  4.1203])
It is a very average store with average products. | tensor([ 8.5649, -2.0148, -2.1680, -2.2059, -0.6400, -1.7025, -1.7982, -0.7412])
I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. | tensor([ 8.4215, -2.0433, -1.9429, -2.3042, -0.6260, -1.5383, -1.8642, -0.9439])

I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products. | tensor([ 8.1352, -1.5487, -2.0856, -2.7354, -1.1145, -1.9413, -2.2406,  0.9563])
I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. | tensor([ 8.3616, -1.6297, -2.4840, -2.2870, -0.3396, -1.9188, -1.9326, -0.5786])

The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. | tensor([ 8.5031, -1.9940, -2.3634, -2.6077, -0.1143, -1.9059, -1.9717, -0.4584])
It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\n\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). | tensor([ 7.6020,  0.4918, -2.6417, -2.8093, -1.6362, -2.0622, -2.0867,  1.2324])
\n\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \"good\" Dick's location. | tensor([ 8.5302, -1.6026, -2.3716, -2.5349, -0.6964, -1.9302, -1.8564, -0.3520])

I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? | tensor([ 8.3125e+00, -1.7616e+00, -2.4150e+00, -2.7728e+00, -9.8302e-02,

but I figured... | tensor([ 8.4300, -2.1503, -2.2501, -2.8477,  0.1647, -1.6098, -2.1586, -0.3260])

I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). | tensor([ 8.6365, -1.8774, -2.2882, -2.5841, -0.2595, -1.9201, -1.9820, -0.5972])

Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair? | tensor([ 8.5943, -2.0993, -2.2288, -2.1479, -0.4509, -2.4397, -1.5893, -0.4531])

  Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming, annoying and pushy, I can see how he can be very helpful to the average Joe, but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework, as this place is not walmart, mid to high level product here. | tensor([ 7.8834, -0.2963, -3.0723, -1.2402, -0.2783, -2.4143, -2.6938, -0.1455])
I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.   | tensor([ 8.3489, -1.7194, -1.8146, -2.7021, -1.0172, -2.2174, -2.0536,  0.2473])

 the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called. | tensor([ 8.1344, -2.5191, -2.0159, -1.4525, -0.7790, -2.3534, -1.4890, -0.0627])

I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 8.0049, -0.9219, -2.4078, -2.2127, -1.1789, -1.8703, -2.7161,  0.9090])

When they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. | tensor([ 8.1672, -1.4633, -2.4337, -2.6138, -0.1811, -1.8612, -2.0350, -0.5241])

Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. | tensor([ 8.0912, -1.1236, -2.5523, -2.0828,  0.0226, -2.0132, -2.2959, -0.7374])

Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.\n\nI live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. | tensor([ 8.3750, -2.5215, -2.1653, -1.7233, -0.8827, -1.5851, -1.4681, -0.6242])
Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\n\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. | tensor([ 8.2567, -1.1736, -2.2487, -2.5340, -1.3766, -1.5369, -2.1285,  0.1634])

Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\n\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\n\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. | tensor([ 2.1790, -0.5883, -1.8182, -0.3195,  2.4911,  0.4253, -1.6882, -0.6344])

My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\n\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. | tensor([ 1.7201, -2.6668,  4.9932, -2.9187, -4.0195,  2.7013, -1.4800,  0.0826])
I totally understand it -- family time is important! | tensor([ 0.9183,  3.6017, -1.8021, -3.4954,  2.0664, -2.2283, -1.4827,  3.4736])
-- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). | tensor([ 8.5503, -1.7743, -2.1446, -2.4110, -0.3291, -2.3300, -2.1176, -0.3314])
I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. | tensor([ 8.3135, -1.2053, -2.5605, -2.1087, -0.2485, -2.1076, -2.1795, -0.3549])

The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. | tensor([ 7.8603, -0.1974, -3.1423, -2.3967, -0.1306, -2.4158, -0.4122, -1.1051])
Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. | tensor([ 8.6207, -1.6929, -2.3817, -2.4027, -0.4963, -2.0579, -1.7946, -0.5723])

I wouldn't go back | tensor([ 8.5668, -1.7516, -1.9513, -2.8728, -0.8755, -1.8043, -1.7891, -0.1250])

\n\nI usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.   | tensor([ 7.9872, -1.8756, -2.4845, -1.3895, -0.3631, -2.1737, -1.6185, -0.3607])

Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.\n\nIt's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies. | tensor([ 8.3910, -1.7793, -2.3766, -1.4001, -0.9469, -2.4390, -1.8120, -0.2635])

They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen. | tensor([ 8.3911, -2.1341, -2.1424, -2.4595,  0.0661, -2.5670, -1.7296, -0.3350])

I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions. | tensor([ 5.5723,  0.5743, -3.0434, -1.2330,  1.2876, -1.9546, -2.6278, -0.0093])

The owner kept her back turn to us the entire time, based on the pictures and news articles I read about her I thought she would have been more social. | tensor([ 8.6268, -1.8461, -2.4895, -2.9818, -0.1919, -1.3858, -1.4712, -0.9513])
To what really matters we got #2 sampler and order of jalape\u00f1o pierogies and the Ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys. | tensor([ 8.5966, -2.4963, -2.0934, -2.5511, -0.2198, -1.7467, -1.4430, -0.9964])

I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try. | tensor([ 8.5628, -1.4433, -2.3326, -1.8783, -1.0663, -2.2346, -2.1502, -0.0645])

The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.   | tensor([ 7.3966, -0.9229, -3.0337, -3.1187,  1.6486, -1.2941, -2.1671, -0.8992])
Everyone in the table resented me for \"holding back\" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\n\nWhich | tensor([ 7.3862, -1.7689, -2.1264, -2.6750, -0.1972, -2.2183,  1.2890, -2.5380])

And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\n\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits. | tensor([ 8.4939, -2.0470, -2.0894, -2.1876, -0.6600, -1.6790, -1.6601, -0.9872])

I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.   | tensor([ 8.6134, -2.1742, -2.4841, -2.9209,  0.2913, -1.9473, -1.7435, -0.5318])
I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted. | tensor([ 8.2119, -1.9725, -2.4416, -2.1097, -0.0857, -1.4211, -1.9033, -0.6573])

The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. | tensor([ 8.4928, -1.9417, -2.4232, -2.8964,  0.3842, -1.9717, -1.8401, -0.6755])
I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. | tensor([ 8.4901, -2.0751, -2.4300, -2.6784,  0.0716, -2.5033, -1.4718, -0.2828])
I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. | tensor([ 8.2719, -2.0256, -1.9964, -2.9889, -0.6454, -0.9133, -2.5473, -0.1611])
I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. | tensor([ 8.5219, -2.0056, -2.3287, -1.7295, -0.5078, -2.1747, -2.0873, -0.3794])

Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. | tensor([ 8.4961, -1.9704, -2.3952, -2.2950, -0.0496, -2.0291, -1.7226, -0.8632])
Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. | tensor([ 7.1362, -1.5778, -0.8488, -1.6120, -1.1517, -2.6161, -2.4429,  0.6604])

The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \"I taste like iodine\" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. | tensor([ 8.2748, -2.1915, -2.5710, -1.8953, -0.3319, -2.1616, -1.0819, -0.7630])
Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive). | tensor([ 8.4160, -1.5956, -2.2644, -1.6216, -0.9619, -2.0491, -2.1253, -0.3533])

My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them. | tensor([ 8.4340, -1.9433, -2.2278, -2.5176, -0.3688, -1.7520, -2.2004, -0.3199])

I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area. | tensor([ 7.8622, -1.6347, -2.5375, -2.1026, -0.1849, -2.5055, -2.2752,  0.6802])

Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. | tensor([ 8.6695, -1.6047, -2.4030, -2.3689, -0.0594, -2.6067, -1.6082, -0.5928])

I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant. | tensor([ 5.2070, -1.6005, -2.8758, -1.3390,  4.5260, -1.6844, -2.6202, -0.7837])

You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from. | tensor([ 8.5858, -1.5323, -2.6131, -1.9454, -0.0904, -2.4396, -2.0932, -0.4084])

Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there. | tensor([ 8.6264, -1.9767, -2.5238, -2.7410,  0.4543, -1.9212, -2.0874, -0.3562])

I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else. | tensor([ 8.7259, -2.2073, -2.1373, -2.5229, -0.3827, -1.9926, -1.6936, -0.7176])

The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it. | tensor([ 6.4098, -2.0566, -1.3654,  0.8340, -0.5795, -2.0626, -1.4599, -1.8085])

The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy. | tensor([ 8.6831, -1.8444, -2.0922, -2.1545, -0.3549, -2.2755, -2.1956, -0.6095])

Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future. | tensor([ 8.6793, -1.5973, -2.4459, -2.2765, -0.3610, -2.5902, -1.8619, -0.3015])

I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby. | tensor([ 8.6045, -1.7242, -2.4982, -1.7218, -0.3505, -2.5673, -2.1334, -0.3019])

I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :) | tensor([ 7.5976, -1.4901, -0.3525, -2.7831, -1.8516, -1.5912, -2.2825, -0.0677])
Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. | tensor([ 8.5092, -1.7879, -2.3399, -2.4124, -1.0105, -2.1348, -1.8828,  0.2465])
Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. | tensor([ 1.6984, -1.0710,  2.7364, -2.0575, -4.2554,  3.2970, -0.9148, -0.5082])
It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\n\nI've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent... | tensor([ 8.1238, -1.8567, -2.2905, -0.4694, -1.6139, -1.7636, -2.1280, -0.5364])
it's good...satisfying. | tensor([ 7.7670, -1.8476, -2.9781, -2.5911,  1.1758, -1.0170, -2.4574, -0.1948])
Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. | tensor([ 7.8436, -1.9565, -2.5143, -2.1517,  0.5074, -1.1081, -1.6812, -1.4167])
It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\n\nThe portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. | tensor([ 7.7366, -1.5510, -1.8489, -1.6291, -0.2562, -1.5248, -2.0029, -1.3523])
The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. | tensor([ 8.6005, -2.2314, -2.3338, -2.0771, -0.4834, -2.0838, -1.5843, -0.8482])
\n\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\n\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. | tensor([ 7.8445, -1.4872, -2.2242, -1.7493, -1.4107, -1.6751, -0.9762, -1.1850])
But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. | tensor([ 1.3676, -1.5002, -2.7397,  0.6012,  5.5338, -0.6878, -1.7915, -1.6284])
They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\n\nAnd for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. | tensor([ 5.6669, -0.6155, -3.2770, -3.2482, -0.9525,  0.3984,  0.0128,  0.6865])
A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. | tensor([ 8.3015, -2.1291, -2.4335, -2.2717, -0.0635, -1.7227, -2.0149, -0.6514])

But I will say that I have had more free meals here due to them comping me for all messed up orders. | tensor([ 8.7676, -2.3009, -1.7174, -2.5129, -0.6334, -1.8381, -1.6014, -1.1511])

I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry. | tensor([ 8.0282, -1.1619, -2.8525, -3.1499,  0.4870, -1.9590, -0.9319, -1.1239])

and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. | tensor([ 1.0915,  2.3985, -3.5414,  0.5265,  6.0561, -1.7074, -2.0377, -1.1369])

Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. | tensor([ 0.7057,  2.7187, -3.6409,  1.4696,  2.4760, -2.1255,  1.1577, -1.8287])
Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.\n\nThe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. | tensor([ 6.7889, -0.8292, -3.0927, -0.4233,  0.7202, -2.9703, -2.5247,  0.4139])
They don't just vibrate; they knead. | tensor([ 8.0096, -2.3307, -2.3689, -1.0939, -0.5814, -1.7804, -1.5770, -0.8139])
The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. | tensor([ 8.5716, -1.6332, -2.4377, -1.7776, -0.7846, -2.0922, -2.2394,  0.0433])
I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. | tensor([ 8.5357, -1.8011, -2.1664, -2.6200, -1.2168, -1.1347, -1.8384, -0.1533])
The foot bath was nice and warm. | tensor([ 7.9714, -1.2328, -2.5080, -2.8140, -0.2912, -1.7178, -2.6318,  0.7011])
I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\n\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. | tensor([ 7.4695, -1.2565, -3.3440,  0.0716, -0.4525, -2.3676, -1.9611, -0.4096])
She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. | tensor([ 8.1727, -0.6937, -3.0095, -2.2712,  0.1803, -2.1759, -2.5313,  0.1057])
It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\n\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. | tensor([ 8.5488, -2.1365, -2.2552, -1.9718, -0.6265, -2.5601, -1.2537, -0.5081])
Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. | tensor([ 8.4067, -2.5113, -2.3319, -2.4264, -0.0880, -1.8693, -1.2140, -0.8095])
The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. | tensor([ 7.9943, -1.3287, -2.5749, -3.6725,  0.1181, -1.5505, -1.4890,  0.3956])
I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. | tensor([ 1.9436,  2.5700, -3.0333, -2.8563,  5.5098, -1.3727, -2.6200,  1.3253])
I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\nEND TMI\n\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. | tensor([ 7.7198, -0.6275, -3.2407, -1.6960,  0.7567, -2.0763, -2.7974, -0.2044])
Polish on and all done! | tensor([ 1.9858, -3.2999,  5.8572, -3.0107, -2.4979,  1.6243, -1.8910, -0.6380])
At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\n\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. | tensor([ 7.8652, -1.1589, -3.0878, -2.1420,  0.6690, -2.1556, -2.3414, -0.1895])
Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). | tensor([ 8.4407, -1.6298, -2.6890, -3.3276,  0.9388, -2.1932, -1.7355, -0.5053])
I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. | tensor([ 8.6940, -2.1921, -2.3507, -2.0925, -0.4142, -2.1711, -1.7941, -0.4795])
I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\n\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. | tensor([ 8.4860, -1.7964, -2.1311, -2.3286, -1.2562, -1.7560, -1.1644, -0.8668])
The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\n\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. | tensor([ 8.4583, -2.0431, -2.5764, -2.4991, -0.2318, -1.9241, -1.9607, -0.0447])
The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. | tensor([ 8.4878, -1.4736, -2.4599, -1.8183, -0.9026, -2.1550, -1.4869, -0.7737])
They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\n\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. | tensor([ 4.1920,  0.5045, -3.0296, -2.1553,  3.5903, -1.1703, -2.2229,  0.2158])
I'm not sure if they do waxing. | tensor([ 8.1979, -1.9566, -1.7877, -2.5155, -0.4477, -1.7398, -1.8423, -0.3303])
I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in. | tensor([ 8.6110, -2.2145, -2.0266, -2.2351, -0.6831, -1.8412, -2.0400, -0.4800])
My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. | tensor([ 8.4658, -1.8961, -2.2867, -3.2437,  0.2140, -1.5865, -2.0946, -0.3289])
I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. | tensor([ 8.5248, -2.0747, -2.3050, -2.3195, -0.4109, -2.2146, -2.0682, -0.0802])
Off to Star Nails we went. | tensor([ 8.6544, -2.4048, -2.2575, -2.8931, -0.2310, -1.2514, -1.6224, -0.6807])
The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. | tensor([ 0.8128, -1.1668, -2.7098, -1.7628,  7.6005,  0.1943, -2.2703, -0.6080])
Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. | tensor([ 8.4848, -2.3737, -2.3902, -2.9168,  0.6704, -1.5135, -1.8423, -1.1565])
We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. | tensor([ 8.3742, -2.4204, -2.0142, -2.7213, -0.5893, -0.8577, -1.5831, -0.8350])
The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. | tensor([ 7.5246, -0.3585, -3.3040, -0.5578, -1.0908, -2.6954, -2.2014,  0.8294])
I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. | tensor([ 8.1061, -1.7847, -2.7339, -3.0758, -0.1594, -0.3177, -2.0611, -0.4861])
Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. | tensor([ 8.0764, -1.6447, -2.5862, -3.0654,  0.4048, -2.0610, -2.0791,  0.3705])
Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. | tensor([ 6.9911, -0.7185, -1.0444, -3.6079, -0.7386, -0.6312, -2.4452,  0.2243])
My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. | tensor([ 8.4316, -1.5913, -2.3074, -3.1407, -0.3033, -2.1649, -1.5909,  0.0363])
At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). | tensor([ 8.4333, -2.3604, -2.2000, -2.9335, -0.1673, -1.6980, -1.4739, -0.6633])
Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time. | tensor([ 6.2933, -1.8786, -1.2982, -3.7687, -1.3086,  2.0521, -0.8359, -0.7006])
I got a pedicure here. | tensor([ 8.3990, -2.1144, -2.3589, -2.7353,  0.2091, -1.7099, -2.1095, -0.2270])
Not bad, they were pretty thorough. | tensor([ 8.6141, -2.2202, -2.0449, -3.0392, -0.4843, -1.5954, -1.6542, -0.6051])
But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). | tensor([ 7.5057, -1.8594, -1.9672, -1.3666, -0.0847, -1.4001, -2.5364, -0.3028])
I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt. | tensor([ 8.5172, -1.1251, -2.5839, -1.7679, -0.5837, -2.6911, -2.0104, -0.1771])
This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions). | tensor([ 6.7985, -1.5356, -3.1104,  0.7426,  0.4571, -2.0990, -2.4559, -1.0231])

It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.   | tensor([ 7.9659, -1.3133, -2.1567, -1.8593, -0.7237, -1.7113, -2.8848,  0.2972])
Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. | tensor([ 8.3112, -1.9244, -1.8251, -1.9204, -0.8460, -2.2240, -1.8722, -0.5288])
\n\nBut more importantly the food...   | tensor([ 4.4459, -2.9539,  1.7653, -2.3321, -0.5142, -0.3171, -1.4714, -1.0904])

The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable. | tensor([ 8.5359, -2.0493, -2.3723, -2.3513, -0.3188, -1.5016, -1.8067, -0.8460])

Yes!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nGreat service!\nGreat | tensor([ 8.5055, -2.5522, -2.0411, -2.4413, -0.0100, -1.9900, -1.4221, -1.1526])

STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 6.5288, -1.1383, -1.6075, -3.6246, -1.8396,  1.6905, -0.3695, -1.2513])
they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair. | tensor([ 7.8498, -1.9605, -2.3679, -1.8944,  0.4869, -1.6935, -1.2267, -1.8651])

it was so awkward and weird . | tensor([ 8.4513, -2.0194, -2.2442, -2.7518,  0.2500, -1.9748, -2.1706, -0.1999])

I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.   | tensor([ 8.5091, -2.2086, -2.1103, -2.3783, -0.8410, -1.6915, -1.5368, -0.5258])
They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. | tensor([ 8.5327, -2.1090, -1.6845, -1.6199, -1.0246, -1.6682, -1.7754, -1.2733])

she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients. | tensor([ 8.6312, -2.3952, -2.1646, -2.5999, -0.0924, -2.0444, -1.1838, -1.1890])

I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients! | tensor([ 8.5887, -2.4463, -1.9818, -2.3642, -0.4755, -2.1320, -1.1881, -1.0576])

I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there! | tensor([ 6.1798, -2.5857, -0.1330, -2.8763, -2.4874,  0.9082, -0.2712, -1.1126])

I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment). | tensor([ 8.5500, -2.1477, -2.2712, -1.6342, -0.6580, -2.3471, -1.5941, -0.7354])
 I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.   | tensor([ 8.3713, -2.1490, -2.4134, -2.2779, -0.3047, -2.1295, -1.7150, -0.0743])

I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.   | tensor([ 8.6076, -1.8501, -2.2877, -2.4860, -0.5494, -2.2979, -1.9448,  0.0436])
Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \"Oh hi.   | tensor([ 8.5887, -1.8802, -2.0848, -2.3280, -0.6922, -2.3947, -1.5458, -0.4380])

When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place. | tensor([ 8.4950, -1.5889, -2.4974, -2.8729,  0.1438, -2.3634, -2.0810,  0.1590])

Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers. | tensor([ 8.4393, -1.7934, -2.5785, -2.6475, -0.0125, -2.0450, -1.7831, -0.1745])

First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \"difficult\" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut. | tensor([ 2.8697,  2.9189, -3.4297, -0.4435,  3.9307, -0.6590, -2.3788, -1.3261])

Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \"Locks of Love,\" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.   | tensor([ 8.5268, -1.9808, -2.5543, -2.7168, -0.0449, -2.0963, -1.5087, -0.4948])
I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\n\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn. | tensor([ 7.7786, -0.9534, -3.3478, -1.7054,  1.2426, -2.2275, -2.7143, -0.1344])

One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \"wasn't looking right.\"  Ummm, okay. | tensor([ 7.1174, -0.0849, -3.1474, -2.3507,  1.5136, -2.3591, -2.4068,  0.0951])

The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \"I have to leave, | tensor([ 7.7073, -1.2059, -3.2866, -2.6797,  2.2083, -2.4487, -1.3367, -0.7591])

The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. | tensor([ 8.6025, -2.1841, -2.1342, -2.2558, -0.7108, -2.1402, -1.7000, -0.3590])

The place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel; as I took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular. | tensor([ 6.9238,  0.8354, -2.5901, -2.8144, -0.0254, -2.0441, -2.1381,  0.2184])

There weren't many people when I was there (it was still relatively early) | tensor([ 8.4781, -1.4284, -2.3593, -2.1425, -0.6573, -2.2750, -2.4488,  0.3464])
but I got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door. | tensor([ 8.2588, -2.5671, -2.0524, -1.3348, -0.3534, -1.6969, -1.6505, -1.2071])
 \nOne thing that I didn't like was although they had many pastries to choose from, nothing was labeled.   | tensor([ 8.0424, -1.9898, -2.7393, -2.2368,  0.9605, -2.0003, -2.2012, -0.6400])

Their bread selection, however, was very limited and upon making our choice the quality of the bread was mediocre. | tensor([ 3.0780, -1.5249,  5.6135, -2.0898, -2.9941, -1.6021, -1.9753, -0.5211])
We were also disappointed that many of the things in the shop are not labeled and when the store is busy it can be difficult to find staff to explain what different options are. | tensor([ 8.6728, -1.4727, -2.5299, -2.1641, -0.5966, -2.3026, -1.7103, -0.4439])

Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. | tensor([ 7.8379, -1.5631, -2.3599, -1.8629, -0.8131, -1.0265, -1.6787, -1.0212])

So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.   | tensor([ 8.6546, -2.3163, -2.0268, -2.5440, -0.6887, -1.6456, -1.5038, -0.8623])

This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot. | tensor([ 8.4063, -1.8822, -2.3987, -2.5582, -0.6841, -0.8467, -2.3055, -0.5605])

The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it. | tensor([ 8.2939, -1.8931, -2.2300, -2.7432, -0.6416, -1.8780, -1.8816,  0.0962])

I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation. | tensor([ 7.3457e+00,  2.9012e-03, -2.3592e+00, -3.2245e+00, -2.5441e-01,

In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.   | tensor([ 6.1430,  2.4856, -1.7031, -1.6744, -1.6396, -1.7152, -2.8163,  0.0857])
But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on. | tensor([ 4.7468, -1.2470, -2.8450, -2.6082,  4.9696, -1.2421, -2.9185,  0.4299])

After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! | tensor([ 8.6352, -2.2608, -2.2105, -2.3376, -0.3761, -2.2542, -1.0176, -1.0834])

This thrift store is one of the best in Pittsburgh; it's huge and has a great selection of books, clothes and housewares.\n\nWith that being said, there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity. | tensor([ 5.1844, -0.0326, -1.7840, -3.1899, -1.9184,  1.4566, -1.4532,  0.7441])

Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. | tensor([-1.2234,  2.2174, -3.1635, -0.1806, -0.1435,  2.6305,  0.3311,  1.6961])

I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.\n\nAlso, they're cash only.\n\nDespite these setbacks, I find myself coming back every few months because I've found some really awesome things here, from dresses to plates. | tensor([ 1.7251,  0.4890, -3.0216, -1.4583,  4.7725, -0.9018, -0.2785, -1.6192])

I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) . | tensor([ 8.4022, -1.4572, -2.6350, -1.2996, -0.8940, -1.7666, -1.6070, -1.0319])

You always seem to get lots of food for very little money, which is nice. | tensor([ 1.4876, -1.0087,  3.9586, -0.4777, -4.1314, -0.0343,  0.3794, -1.6149])
 \n\nMy only complaint is that it is WAY TOO SMALL and always very busy.   | tensor([ 7.9813, -2.1567, -1.8385, -1.6999, -1.9588, -0.4462, -1.1315, -1.1709])
They should really look at expanding the restaurant. | tensor([ 6.5030, -1.7374, -1.8079, -2.7339,  2.1347, -1.5171, -2.7016, -0.2902])
I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail. | tensor([ 7.0205, -1.1147, -0.4131, -3.8692, -0.9420, -1.9631, -2.6350,  1.4235])

I love little local restaurants like this. | tensor([ 7.0918,  0.1421, -2.7909, -1.3954, -0.9762, -1.2468, -3.1096,  0.6226])

But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.   | tensor([ 8.3568, -1.7125, -2.4190, -2.3246, -0.7017, -1.5793, -2.3587, -0.0421])
They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room. | tensor([ 8.6884, -2.2853, -1.9484, -2.1058, -0.7723, -2.3274, -1.0951, -1.0538])

We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.   | tensor([ 6.9120,  1.5115, -2.7877, -1.9628, -1.2048, -3.0540, -2.4560,  1.0970])

I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor. | tensor([ 3.9539,  1.7523, -2.9020, -0.2397,  0.8728, -0.9605, -3.2871,  0.8428])

To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.   | tensor([ 8.3639, -1.6607, -2.3367, -2.4690, -0.8869, -1.2733, -2.4224,  0.0256])
For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds. | tensor([ 7.6752, -0.4256, -2.3298, -1.3868, -0.6077, -2.0208, -2.1266, -0.9568])
Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThey have a wide selection of breakfast options.   | tensor([ 8.4137, -1.4335, -2.1829, -2.4534, -0.9417, -2.7325, -1.8657,  0.3057])
However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast. | tensor([ 7.5391, -1.3475, -2.9279, -1.3309,  0.3624, -1.8563, -2.2821, -0.6038])

I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes. | tensor([ 5.7545, -0.9171, -2.7711, -0.6532,  1.5491, -0.6053, -3.3927, -0.5960])

I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried. | tensor([ 8.1508, -1.6192, -2.4777, -1.6656, -0.0459, -1.7848, -2.5186, -0.6602])

My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much. | tensor([ 8.4861, -2.0997, -2.2933, -1.9784, -0.3658, -2.0622, -1.9687, -0.6546])
 \n\nWe were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded. | tensor([ 8.4942, -1.4541, -2.6529, -2.8270,  0.1643, -1.3529, -1.8725, -1.1819])

And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"   | tensor([ 8.3051, -1.3699, -2.7332, -1.4598, -0.7448, -2.7054, -2.0459,  0.0920])
Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again. | tensor([ 5.2888, -2.0114, -2.3705, -2.1086, -1.0536,  1.5883, -2.0161,  0.9291])

I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. | tensor([ 8.4626, -2.0104, -2.5666, -2.6476,  0.3961, -1.5545, -2.2161, -0.6061])
The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. | tensor([ 6.4232, -2.6851, -1.7087, -3.8268,  0.6682,  2.4302, -2.6891, -0.7312])

I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. | tensor([ 4.4954, -0.7258, -3.5831, -1.6316,  5.3489, -1.6023, -2.5656, -0.5394])

We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table. | tensor([ 8.5736, -2.3266, -2.2355, -2.6269,  0.3731, -2.1121, -1.6128, -0.9982])

The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\n\nFor my entree | tensor([ 8.6110, -2.0002, -2.2470, -2.4895, -0.1406, -2.2578, -1.7035, -0.6698])
I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet. | tensor([ 3.1292,  2.5421, -3.1785, -2.7119,  2.8142, -1.3311, -2.6558,  1.7706])

Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it. | tensor([ 7.2244e+00, -2.1327e+00, -1.7095e+00, -2.4370e+00,  7.8533e-01,

It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better. | tensor([ 8.3514, -1.4640, -2.4514, -2.3974, -0.4362, -1.3496, -2.2435, -0.7106])

Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye. | tensor([ 8.2928, -2.2429, -2.4140, -2.7904,  0.3753, -1.3789, -1.9363, -0.9741])

The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy. | tensor([ 0.4926, -1.1202, -1.5685, -2.7733,  6.5156, -0.0938, -1.8490, -0.1290])

My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza. | tensor([ 7.5915,  0.4830, -2.8962, -2.5944,  0.5778, -2.1300, -2.7122, -0.2016])

Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.   | tensor([ 6.5385,  1.1939, -2.5034, -2.7523, -1.0268,  0.4426, -2.7792, -0.2075])

If there are any problems, the prices a bit high for diner food and, as others have said, it's extremely cramped. | tensor([ 8.5316, -1.3020, -2.5771, -1.8367, -0.8379, -2.1677, -1.9803, -0.4914])

Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.\n\nIt's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. | tensor([ 3.5697,  0.0662, -3.1009, -3.0140, -1.4219,  1.6732, -0.4076,  1.5574])
I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.\n\nRusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. | tensor([ 8.5419, -1.8956, -2.3084, -1.9069, -0.8625, -2.4855, -1.2508, -0.6630])
In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. | tensor([ 8.4293, -2.0167, -1.7475, -2.3673, -1.2662, -1.5179, -1.7780, -0.6640])
As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. | tensor([-2.2522,  2.4624, -2.8064,  3.6552,  1.2252,  0.4569,  1.0351, -2.5005])
And indeed, all IS fine.\n\nSo few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. | tensor([ 7.8665, -1.6245, -2.5041, -0.7503, -1.5979, -1.5497, -1.0780, -0.9765])

As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\n\nBottom line... | tensor([ 8.5677, -1.9752, -2.0047, -2.1757, -0.7756, -1.7203, -1.8559, -0.8594])

1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. | tensor([ 8.2487, -2.2615, -2.3041, -2.7230,  0.2138, -1.5201, -1.3251, -1.2302])

2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. | tensor([ 8.6682, -2.1747, -2.4431, -1.7991, -0.1571, -2.4276, -1.6632, -0.8118])

Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there. | tensor([ 8.6268, -1.9846, -2.3798, -2.3761, -0.1772, -2.2943, -1.7462, -0.5541])

Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby. | tensor([ 8.3067, -2.3274, -2.3271, -2.2322, -0.4127, -1.3045, -2.1258, -0.3540])

It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live. | tensor([ 8.5701, -1.6886, -2.2034, -1.9814, -0.8878, -2.2268, -1.9102, -0.3578])

Good selection, but it will cost you.\nMultiple fridges of cold beer, but only the cheap beer is cold.\nNice in person, but rude on the phone.\nParking lot, but none of the customers understand how to park.\n\nEvery good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. | tensor([ 8.5542, -2.2068, -2.4930, -1.9507, -0.2729, -2.0054, -1.5165, -0.8772])
I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.\n\nWhy 4 you ask, when I just went through all that 3 star crap? | tensor([ 8.6747, -1.9555, -2.2646, -2.2367, -0.4364, -2.3249, -1.8226, -0.5424])
Any place that offers beer samples provided by attractive women gets a half star boost for sure, and as long as I'm going there anyway it really makes for a more interesting trip.\n\nAfter all, if you don't like free beer, you are probably a terrorist. | tensor([-0.3787, -3.6370,  5.2289, -2.7201, -0.4122,  0.3732,  0.7117, -0.7799])

I'm sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores. | tensor([ 7.5706, -0.9793, -2.4519, -2.2551, -0.7398, -0.9315, -2.6159,  0.1004])

They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. \n\nThey actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. | tensor([ 7.6470, -2.0053, -0.7889, -3.3827, -1.7638,  0.7154, -1.7628, -0.7510])

Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. | tensor([ 8.5821, -2.1765, -1.8760, -2.6576, -0.7468, -1.6299, -1.5491, -0.9843])

I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same. | tensor([ 8.6312, -2.3242, -2.0504, -2.3819, -0.3203, -1.5544, -1.8268, -1.0842])
I made it back here about two weeks ago. | tensor([ 8.5179, -1.8790, -2.2889, -2.9391, -0.3403, -1.2559, -2.2062, -0.2906])

I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July. | tensor([ 8.5738, -1.7829, -1.9948, -2.9473, -0.8899, -2.0207, -2.1369,  0.4108])

Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best. | tensor([ 7.5830, -1.8389, -1.7103, -1.1608, -1.2752, -2.4847, -2.2272,  0.1903])

I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge. | tensor([ 8.1686, -1.6629, -1.9287, -3.3735, -1.0726, -1.3110, -2.2804,  0.8406])

I won't becoming back anytime soon. | tensor([ 8.6788, -2.1995, -2.0392, -2.8933, -0.3229, -1.5544, -1.7112, -0.8509])
I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch. | tensor([ 8.5443, -1.8650, -2.0663, -1.9179, -0.8002, -2.0010, -2.2311, -0.3574])

Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.   | tensor([ 8.2424, -2.2113, -2.3145, -1.4769, -0.1302, -2.1047, -1.6444, -1.2509])
We literally waited 15 mins. | tensor([ 8.6237, -1.8700, -2.1415, -2.7546, -0.3441, -2.1511, -1.8415, -0.3201])
at our table and then left prior to ordering. | tensor([ 8.3773, -2.4822, -2.5043, -2.7533,  0.8355, -1.6355, -1.5806, -1.1969])
I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace. | tensor([ 8.2482, -1.7117, -2.2949, -1.3054, -1.6712, -1.5681, -1.7566, -0.4402])

My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \"Italian frites.\"   | tensor([ 5.0616, -2.7044,  2.8724, -1.8836, -3.2858, -0.6289, -0.3276, -1.5906])
The latter, which the menu described as \"fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag. | tensor([ 6.3151, -1.5108, -2.5184, -0.7410,  1.0035, -1.0052, -0.5754, -2.6901])

The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce. | tensor([ 3.6284,  0.0269, -1.5908, -0.1082,  0.0433,  1.7257, -1.3441, -1.6937])

Talk about a profit margin!\n\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper. | tensor([ 8.3371, -2.2868, -2.7032, -2.6532,  0.2824, -1.5384, -1.2140, -1.2156])

It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.   | tensor([ 8.6847, -1.7286, -2.1037, -2.2058, -0.9035, -2.4063, -1.6809, -0.3825])

Classless.\n\nConclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's. | tensor([ 8.5712, -1.8733, -2.3705, -2.1437, -0.6380, -2.1047, -1.3269, -0.8767])
Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. | tensor([ 8.4582, -2.3787, -1.9919, -2.3261, -0.7050, -1.3291, -1.4862, -1.1893])
Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. | tensor([ 8.1780, -1.8529, -2.6104, -2.0949, -0.0882, -1.3987, -1.6683, -1.2574])
A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. | tensor([ 8.0473, -1.9154, -2.3239, -1.5235, -0.4998, -2.0116, -1.2636, -1.2726])
Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. | tensor([ 7.3394, -0.3400, -2.9537, -0.8264, -0.9257, -1.2854, -2.5768, -0.3239])
As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again. | tensor([ 8.4228, -1.7700, -1.9774, -2.1409, -0.5284, -1.9703, -1.9997, -0.8278])
\"God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!\"  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's. | tensor([ 5.4141, -2.6862,  2.1320, -2.8998, -3.3370,  0.5130, -1.7155,  0.2444])

I had the roasted veggie platter for my entree, which is really an appetizer--and I had to share--way too much for one person to eat.   | tensor([ 0.0717, -0.1765, -2.2179,  7.8117, -0.0271, -1.3501, -2.1440, -1.5668])
Another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at Pino's) was that it was the best Italian dressing that he ever had. | tensor([ 5.1746, -2.2426,  2.1909, -1.5986, -3.4274,  0.2273, -1.5773, -0.8489])

As I write, I want to go back for dinner tonight!!\n\nForgot to mention, they also have local beers on tap (East End Brewery), the men enjoyed the Homewood brew (dark lager type beer), it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses! | tensor([ 8.5149, -2.0310, -2.2139, -2.2950, -1.1032, -2.0876, -1.6296, -0.2002])

I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.   | tensor([ 8.5768, -2.0254, -2.0418, -1.9578, -1.3340, -1.6387, -1.8369, -0.3458])
We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in. | tensor([ 8.3265, -2.6939, -2.3253, -2.5904,  0.2180, -2.0699, -0.9125, -1.1404])

We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella. | tensor([ 4.6797, -1.1592, -2.4612,  0.9045,  1.4386, -0.0223, -2.1696, -2.1482])

We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer. | tensor([ 3.4873,  2.1908, -3.1595,  0.6940,  0.5189, -2.1936, -1.0162, -0.4292])

The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order. | tensor([ 8.3039, -1.7726, -2.1711, -2.6882, -0.5419, -1.3593, -1.7349, -0.9563])

It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish. | tensor([ 7.7363, -1.7349, -2.7011, -2.4874,  1.5582, -1.1986, -2.8494, -0.8200])

I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night. | tensor([ 8.5798, -1.7477, -2.4821, -2.2119, -0.0663, -2.1670, -2.4226, -0.2041])

My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce. | tensor([ 8.2651, -2.0497, -1.8748, -1.8037, -0.9781, -1.0972, -2.1432, -0.8985])
 Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.   | tensor([ 6.7740, -2.5008, -2.7644, -2.7074,  3.4703, -1.1754, -2.0929, -1.2445])

Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way). | tensor([ 8.3502, -1.8988, -2.1897, -1.7360, -1.1255, -2.5371, -2.3130,  0.6623])

I find that we are well served, not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch We have several times asked the Chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. | tensor([ 5.1376,  0.8639, -2.2100,  1.4697, -0.1691, -2.3499, -1.7945, -1.8638])

Makes you feel like coming back.\nI would have to admit that I usually order the garlic fries which are really great. | tensor([ 7.7515e+00, -1.6947e+00, -2.5300e+00, -1.7696e+00,  3.7919e-03,

I heard it used to be much better | tensor([ 6.5178, -1.1401, -0.9872, -2.7470, -2.2437,  2.2020, -2.9878, -0.1610])

Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite... | tensor([ 7.9694, -2.1020, -2.2685, -2.3689, -0.3993, -1.1380, -2.3198, -0.2865])
the roasted veggie platter. | tensor([ 0.1696, -0.7162, -2.1592,  7.1464,  0.3829, -0.5448, -2.6209, -1.5166])

So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!   | tensor([ 7.2278, -0.9555,  0.4940, -2.3205, -2.4692, -1.3444, -2.6123, -0.3004])
They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air-- | tensor([ 8.2355, -1.4131, -1.5700, -2.7144, -1.2478, -0.6451, -2.5384, -0.4002])

I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions. | tensor([ 7.6027, -1.5624, -2.9399, -2.8658,  1.9217, -1.8484, -2.8681,  0.1802])

We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.   | tensor([ 4.1082, -1.5987, -0.9667, -2.4874, -0.9598,  0.3593, -2.8043,  2.3248])
It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately. | tensor([ 8.0415, -1.2567, -2.7483, -2.2881, -0.4431, -1.7235, -2.5813,  0.4247])

I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque. | tensor([ 7.8471, -1.5992, -2.9591, -2.9387,  1.5461, -1.5513, -2.1216, -0.6820])

My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely. | tensor([ 7.7499, -2.2066, -1.8416, -1.8399,  0.0274, -1.4679, -1.9336, -1.0080])

but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing. | tensor([ 3.2950, -0.8929, -2.6563,  4.6793,  0.4177, -1.2575, -2.8826, -1.3214])

I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it. | tensor([ 7.8956, -1.6563, -2.6619, -2.3106,  0.9036, -1.6626, -2.4966, -0.2332])

For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos. | tensor([ 1.3239, -3.2021,  0.7465, -2.4320,  0.7593,  5.6489, -2.1444, -0.6587])

The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick. | tensor([-0.0078, -2.7144,  1.5460, -2.1268, -1.8438,  7.5941, -1.9681, -0.7089])

My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good. | tensor([ 8.4930, -1.4652, -2.5165, -2.4734, -0.2344, -1.7985, -2.3488, -0.3056])

and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish. | tensor([ 3.4276, -2.5859, -0.2797, -2.4659, -0.0235,  5.0040, -2.3938, -1.4556])

I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered. | tensor([ 7.6348, -2.7905, -1.0799, -2.0630, -0.9333, -0.8267, -1.8877, -0.3673])

Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.   | tensor([ 8.3153, -1.5793, -2.1494, -1.9386, -0.6026, -1.1944, -2.2917, -0.9269])
Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates. | tensor([ 8.1026, -1.0321, -2.9233, -2.1560,  0.4109, -2.3022, -2.4175, -0.2825])

For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee. | tensor([ 8.5908, -2.2701, -2.2846, -2.2396, -0.2405, -2.1201, -1.8065, -0.5441])

My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry. | tensor([ 1.2950, -0.7870, -2.5250, -1.4487,  7.0480, -1.2920, -2.4586, -0.1783])

All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry! | tensor([ 2.4569,  5.0903, -1.6376, -0.2776, -0.2897, -0.1880, -2.7136, -0.6582])

My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future. | tensor([ 8.5747, -1.8816, -2.5070, -2.6033, -0.0208, -2.1261, -1.7919, -0.5472])

Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good. | tensor([ 8.5744, -1.9709, -2.0450, -2.0250, -0.8617, -1.9097, -2.2513, -0.2746])
I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. | tensor([ 8.1053, -1.3383, -1.9762, -1.5078, -1.5813, -1.5106, -2.3345, -0.2581])

The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. | tensor([ 8.4528, -2.3339, -2.1652, -2.7825,  0.0708, -1.1864, -2.0648, -0.8410])
$22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? | tensor([ 2.9453, -1.6362, -2.4671, -1.3550,  4.7273, -0.2300, -2.5512, -0.3572])
It claimed to be \"fresh pasta,\" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \"al dente,\" just undercooked), and not very large. | tensor([ 3.9667,  2.1956, -1.6287, -1.7121, -1.1190,  2.6343, -2.6076, -1.6490])
I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... | tensor([ 8.0778, -1.7040, -2.0835, -2.8908,  0.5857, -1.3526, -2.7827, -0.2441])

\n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. | tensor([ 7.9702, -2.4501, -2.3742, -2.7497, -0.1472, -1.4115,  0.1640, -1.7458])
\n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.   | tensor([ 0.5908, -2.0873, -0.1970, -1.7469,  2.7745,  3.4306, -2.0384, -0.6777])
I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. | tensor([ 0.9136,  0.3252, -2.4080,  6.4419, -0.2190, -0.6653, -2.0344, -1.6603])
\n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. | tensor([ 8.1191, -0.8954, -2.9210, -1.7286, -0.3515, -1.4962, -2.3952, -0.8115])
\n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. | tensor([ 1.3139, -4.2539,  4.2525, -3.2433, -2.0004,  4.5114, -1.1943, -1.2259])

The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty | tensor([ 3.8951, -1.2411,  0.8615, -0.0343, -3.1144,  2.3157, -1.3689, -1.8325])

We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). | tensor([ 8.5128, -1.8235, -1.6897, -2.4530, -1.1492, -1.4062, -1.8901, -0.8568])
\n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left. | tensor([ 8.5011, -2.5158, -2.1346, -2.7030, -0.0151, -1.7800, -1.3453, -1.1195])

We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. | tensor([ 8.2030, -1.1257, -1.9894, -2.2348, -1.0334, -1.7535, -1.9177, -0.6104])

The wait staff was far below average: They were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. | tensor([ 7.4687, -0.5202, -2.8269,  0.0129, -1.7437, -2.6145, -1.4531, -0.5307])
They were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward. | tensor([ 6.9428, -1.5456, -2.3682, -2.2342,  1.7668, -1.0362, -2.5721, -1.1949])

In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \" we have to get to Pinos!\" Needless to say, we were disappointed.   | tensor([ 1.2883, -1.4699,  4.6823, -2.0161, -3.5509,  0.5678, -0.1642, -0.0485])

It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.   | tensor([ 8.2375, -2.5072, -1.4947, -0.7341, -1.2787, -2.4244, -1.5768, -1.1209])

I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. | tensor([ 8.3259, -1.5476, -2.2637, -1.4870, -0.6676, -2.3509, -2.2015, -0.4304])

I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. | tensor([ 3.6128, -1.2523, -1.4219, -0.9527,  0.6813,  2.7983, -2.2548, -1.7200])

\nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. | tensor([ 7.1686, -1.8398, -2.2162, -1.1132, -0.0439, -0.6773, -1.7309, -1.4299])

\nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? | tensor([ 8.4160, -2.1049, -2.5663, -2.2143,  0.2332, -1.8065, -1.8434, -0.9569])
Why? \nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge... | tensor([ 1.3693, -2.6416,  2.2705, -0.8547, -2.2850,  0.3330, -0.4044,  0.1573])

She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\n\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. | tensor([ 8.3732, -1.5217, -2.8247, -2.3186, -0.1701, -2.0631, -1.9315, -0.0584])

The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. | tensor([ 8.6110, -1.8511, -2.3199, -2.7036, -0.1273, -2.3554, -1.4216, -0.7190])

He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. | tensor([ 8.6897, -2.3714, -2.1413, -2.1933, -0.4324, -2.2159, -1.4113, -0.9691])

The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions. | tensor([ 8.5318, -2.1071, -1.9875, -2.4220, -0.8250, -1.9153, -1.6841, -0.5638])

I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\n\nPino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women. | tensor([ 7.5280, -0.7204, -2.3546, -1.5650, -0.0795, -1.6604, -1.9924, -0.8703])

You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\n\nYou know that a trip to a large, \"one size fits all\" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.   | tensor([ 7.2469,  0.2724, -3.0538, -1.5879, -0.7882, -1.4900, -2.3009, -0.0411])

I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has. | tensor([ 8.5524, -1.9118, -2.0081, -2.1764, -0.8619, -1.8924, -1.8046, -0.5864])

Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself. | tensor([ 8.4189, -2.2758, -1.9704, -1.9801, -1.2111, -1.3117, -1.6936, -0.8279])

My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.   | tensor([ 8.4753, -2.0997, -1.8424, -2.0057, -1.1247, -1.3265, -1.7680, -0.8878])
It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.   | tensor([ 6.7330,  0.6186, -3.0606, -1.7407, -0.8693, -2.0127, -1.9854,  1.5163])
Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.   | tensor([ 8.4252, -1.7861, -2.3804, -2.5080,  0.4197, -2.0307, -1.7924, -0.8517])
Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) | tensor([ 8.2469, -2.2389, -2.2852, -1.5767, -0.1316, -2.0748, -1.6121, -0.7966])
When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce. | tensor([-0.7893,  2.5293, -2.4970, -0.2445, -0.3800,  2.8805,  1.2701, -0.9176])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Normal enough.\n\n2.) | tensor([ 8.4285e+00, -2.3019e+00, -2.3817e+00, -2.5238e+00, -6.0700e-03,
        -1.5494e+00, -1.8199e+00, -7.3979e-01])
From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy. | tensor([ 7.8360,  0.1184, -3.2484, -1.5542, -0.0744, -2.4166, -1.3079, -1.0825])
 Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery. | tensor([ 1.4888,  1.6093, -1.3441, -3.0264,  4.2947, -2.8317, -0.2265,  0.0841])
  \n\n3.) | tensor([ 8.2674, -2.3372, -2.2584, -2.6870,  0.0552, -1.1120, -1.8238, -0.8726])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall. | tensor([-0.7771,  1.3993,  2.2521, -1.8313,  1.7689, -2.8510,  0.5461, -0.5933])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. | tensor([ 7.3165, -2.1667, -1.9836, -1.4598, -0.4521, -1.0946,  0.0725, -2.6184])
And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right | tensor([ 8.3275, -1.6811, -1.8375, -1.7553, -1.5676, -2.6324, -2.0578,  0.5034])
so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. | tensor([ 8.2395, -1.6378, -2.2235, -2.3772, -0.4840, -1.4788, -2.2029, -0.1969])
(Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) | tensor([ 7.9871, -2.6489, -2.4497, -1.9025, -0.4017, -1.1052, -1.3873, -0.7609])
From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove. | tensor([ 8.4518, -1.6329, -2.0632, -2.3337, -0.8785, -1.9267, -1.8996, -0.5147])

A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) | tensor([ 4.2520,  0.2697, -3.7981,  0.5701,  2.9240, -2.6870,  0.5293, -3.1427])
Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up. | tensor([ 7.5318, -0.5085, -2.9995, -1.1318,  0.0452, -3.1990, -0.9063, -0.8032])
  You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said. | tensor([ 8.6038, -2.1039, -2.4291, -1.7548, -0.5726, -2.4146, -1.4512, -0.6875])

Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was. | tensor([ 8.4724, -1.8626, -2.3656, -1.8479, -0.8668, -2.3153, -1.4467, -0.5391])

There is a reason that store was nicknamed \"the dirty bird.\"   | tensor([ 1.7149, -0.4248, -1.8416, -3.1350, -2.0901,  5.6817,  0.5167, -0.2072])
Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead. | tensor([ 8.5441, -1.5230, -2.5237, -2.3336, -0.4329, -2.4181, -1.8725, -0.0220])
I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating. | tensor([ 8.1806, -0.8939, -2.1563, -1.8201, -1.4349, -2.6286, -1.7848,  0.1407])

From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\n\nThe set up is ridiculous. | tensor([ 8.6029, -2.3363, -2.1389, -2.1336, -0.4752, -2.2839, -1.4089, -0.7327])

I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall | tensor([ 0.4245,  2.2217, -1.5013, -2.4537,  3.2368, -1.8977, -0.2436,  0.8182])
so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it. | tensor([ 8.2844, -1.5582, -2.6416, -2.3047,  0.1009, -1.6680, -2.5597, -0.1006])

Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had. | tensor([ 8.4758, -2.4408, -1.8992, -2.2451, -0.6265, -2.0710, -1.5279, -0.5912])

It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever. | tensor([ 7.4715, -0.7816, -2.5928, -0.2931, -1.4377, -3.1387, -1.9562,  0.6585])
 \n\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping. | tensor([ 8.6526, -1.9512, -2.6389, -2.7466,  0.4064, -2.3866, -1.6695, -0.4413])

\n\nWorst trim of my life:\nshe cut off over an inch more than just the dead/split ends\nshe did not cut the hair how I described initially\nshe did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hair\nafter retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of family/friends and how I should get over it\nthe beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layers\nmy left side is even choppier than the right side of my hair\nI fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evident\n\nI regret tipping her because I understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of work.\n\nI want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are Kelly (who moved to Philly), Melissa and Jen. | tensor([ 8.2565, -1.4724, -2.9575, -3.0839,  0.8443, -2.0518, -1.4981, -0.5711])

I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. | tensor([ 7.6367, -1.0317, -2.5667, -1.9902, -1.9151, -0.1635, -1.7391, -0.4137])

Note: Tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot\n\nTasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. | tensor([-0.4602, -2.7935,  1.8579, -2.0139, -1.6175,  7.4626, -2.0480, -0.7314])
Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).   | tensor([ 0.0822, -2.0738,  0.1541, -2.3814, -2.0174,  8.1695, -1.2744, -0.4682])
However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. | tensor([ 8.6371, -2.0819, -2.4109, -2.0946, -0.2827, -2.4888, -1.6727, -0.4035])
So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice\n\nAnyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). | tensor([ 6.6168, -2.1222, -3.0048,  0.7950,  0.7473, -1.4229, -0.5934, -2.2490])

I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\n\nThe eggroll, as I said, was tough.. | tensor([ 8.6012, -1.6896, -2.4833, -2.3830, -0.3160, -2.1674, -1.9395, -0.5226])

This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... | tensor([ 8.6042, -2.0549, -2.0846, -2.4140, -0.4283, -2.1039, -1.6577, -0.7205])
I hope the soup is good.\n\nThe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered. | tensor([ 0.6718,  1.6306, -3.5888,  0.3701,  6.2387, -0.8923, -1.1335, -1.7398])

Horrible Food don't waste your money\n\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. | tensor([ 8.3360, -1.6891, -2.5305, -1.4888, -0.9089, -2.4513, -1.4304, -0.5402])
IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\n\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. | tensor([ 3.4433,  0.5866, -3.1635, -2.7625, -1.4550,  1.1823, -0.0143,  2.4170])
Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. | tensor([ 8.1557, -1.4093, -2.8411, -1.4274,  0.0338, -2.5595, -2.4417,  0.2816])
I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. | tensor([ 7.4025, -0.2818, -2.1475, -1.7024, -0.8863, -0.9093, -2.4910, -1.1062])

I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. | tensor([ 8.4215, -1.5597, -2.1697, -2.5815, -0.6397, -1.7637, -2.3182, -0.0745])
When I got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. | tensor([ 4.1929, -0.4712, -3.2492, -2.1065,  3.1128, -0.5582,  0.2188, -2.1961])

The \"workers\" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. | tensor([ 4.0592,  0.1067, -2.0834,  1.8577, -3.2788,  1.4245,  0.8751, -2.9167])

Not spectacular, but when you want a good nuthin-fancy dinner, this is the place to go.   | tensor([ 8.3347, -1.8841, -2.3986, -1.7976, -0.4243, -1.9131, -1.9618, -0.7931])
The pizza is outstanding. | tensor([ 8.5855, -2.2556, -2.2096, -2.6107, -0.1630, -1.7966, -1.7653, -0.7715])

On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. | tensor([ 8.6054, -1.6506, -2.3233, -2.7838, -0.5101, -1.8322, -2.1493, -0.0765])
I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. | tensor([ 1.1279, -2.2195,  4.9686, -1.4901, -3.4158,  2.1304, -1.2645, -1.0637])
Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. | tensor([ 1.6722,  3.5068, -1.9785, -2.0792, -1.3276, -2.3048, -1.4127,  4.4726])
In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. | tensor([ 8.4134, -1.7877, -2.0965, -1.9739, -1.1096, -1.2415, -1.8189, -1.0284])
There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. | tensor([ 8.6117, -1.7804, -2.2435, -2.0878, -0.7985, -2.0078, -1.8361, -0.6388])
To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... | tensor([ 8.3811, -1.9811, -1.6676, -2.4037, -0.8618, -1.6648, -2.1964, -0.5639])
It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! | tensor([ 6.1093, -1.9022, -2.5863, -0.1079,  0.3001, -2.4046, -0.9430, -0.7878])

I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. | tensor([ 0.7038,  3.5105, -1.3284, -1.1408, -1.7846,  2.0954, -1.2741,  0.9260])
I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\nThe only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. | tensor([ 8.0837, -1.7784, -2.8886, -2.6979,  1.5143, -2.3185, -1.6371, -0.8790])
It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option. | tensor([ 4.1935,  1.4238, -2.4125,  3.1074, -2.2484, -3.9560, -0.2888, -1.3002])

The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.\n\nWithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate. | tensor([ 8.6327, -2.0883, -2.2421, -2.4492, -0.3836, -2.5000, -1.5022, -0.4430])

I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.\n\nWhen I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task. | tensor([ 8.6725, -1.9103, -2.3819, -2.3191, -0.4059, -2.1542, -1.9460, -0.3272])

My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.   | tensor([ 8.6738, -1.8791, -2.6011, -2.5718,  0.0244, -2.2015, -1.5452, -0.7147])
Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place. | tensor([ 8.3059, -1.4624, -2.6438, -3.2773,  0.6127, -2.1461, -1.9198,  0.1470])

Like many of the reviewers here, I was initially told it would take a certain amount of time, and then, at the last minute, on the day I was supposed to get my car back, they told me it would be a few more days. | tensor([ 8.3255, -1.3765, -2.6604, -1.7318, -1.0346, -2.3154, -1.7090, -0.2284])

Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn't really argue, but I don't know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\n\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.   | tensor([ 8.6557, -2.0323, -2.2795, -2.1272, -0.9662, -1.8173, -1.6150, -0.6271])
All in all, just alright - go here if you're not pressed for time and you've got Geico, otherwise shop around. | tensor([ 8.5544, -2.3771, -2.1543, -2.4110, -0.6533, -1.3755, -1.3799, -1.1461])

It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about. | tensor([ 8.5905, -2.1243, -2.1102, -2.3009, -0.4007, -1.7980, -2.0144, -0.5744])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.   | tensor([ 8.5592, -2.0503, -2.0981, -2.8671, -0.7035, -1.5734, -1.4094, -0.8085])
A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.   | tensor([ 8.3411, -1.6693, -1.9826, -1.6302, -1.4041, -2.1646, -2.2759,  0.1303])
But the thing is, it's not.   | tensor([ 8.3655, -2.4833, -2.1868, -2.8850, -0.1524, -0.7696, -1.8828, -0.7428])
It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic. | tensor([ 8.4088, -1.6670, -1.8974, -2.2226, -1.6266, -1.2554, -1.5197, -0.9534])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I rarely see animals there for a long time. | tensor([ 8.4540, -1.7601, -1.3790, -2.6338, -1.5941, -1.0064, -2.3193, -0.1871])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. | tensor([ 4.9395, -1.9659, -2.3838, -3.4062, -0.9772,  0.6828, -0.6058,  1.7066])
\n\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter. | tensor([ 8.5954, -1.2388, -2.2586, -2.6535, -0.7468, -1.9229, -1.9392, -0.5864])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side. | tensor([ 8.6651, -2.1297, -2.1478, -2.5931, -0.3205, -2.1817, -1.4405, -0.8079])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter. | tensor([ 8.5349, -2.2294, -1.6814, -2.2228, -1.0861, -1.3123, -1.4471, -1.2585])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The cats are all set up in a huge room. | tensor([ 8.6252, -2.0169, -2.1753, -2.2998, -0.5153, -2.0392, -1.8425, -0.5755])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them. | tensor([ 8.4657, -1.7187, -2.2287, -2.1251, -0.4982, -1.9960, -2.3356, -0.3429])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
These rooms are also used for \"cat cuddling.\"   | tensor([ 8.1399, -1.8342, -2.5105, -1.2125, -0.5349, -2.3029, -1.9888, -0.3030])
That's what I do when I volunteer. | tensor([ 7.4631, -1.1440, -3.0760, -1.9916, -0.3479, -1.8878, -1.8521,  0.6951])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around. | tensor([ 8.5248, -1.8036, -2.1396, -1.8644, -0.8129, -1.9357, -1.8189, -0.7762])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. | tensor([ 8.1152, -2.1094, -1.7026, -2.1043, -1.4984,  0.2141, -1.7811, -1.2973])
\n\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted. | tensor([ 8.1195, -2.2317, -2.1065, -2.6309, -0.8987, -1.9056, -0.8284, -0.6958])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. | tensor([ 8.1937, -1.6801, -1.9853, -2.5498, -1.0849, -0.3969, -2.0323, -0.9859])
At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have. | tensor([ 8.3264, -1.5155, -1.8139, -3.2638, -0.8594, -1.5998, -1.7727, -0.5484])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months. | tensor([ 7.9163, -0.7396, -2.4984, -2.8603, -0.1361, -2.2882, -1.9331, -0.5235])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.   | tensor([ 8.4356, -1.9972, -2.3727, -2.1697, -0.5327, -2.2218, -1.6286, -0.4524])
It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. | tensor([ 2.8416,  1.2931, -2.6404,  4.1516, -2.5803, -2.6639, -1.3994,  0.8910])
\n\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend! | tensor([ 7.8177, -1.2198, -2.0972, -3.0280,  0.0708, -0.7245, -2.3345, -1.3501])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
OR you can volunteer! | tensor([ 8.2701, -2.0658, -2.5045, -2.5251,  0.2117, -1.5134, -1.9580, -0.6996])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month. | tensor([ 8.4285, -2.4542, -1.9549, -2.2352, -0.5919, -1.6108, -1.4537, -1.0328])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer! | tensor([ 8.4218, -2.1891, -2.2015, -2.7724, -0.7889, -1.2798, -1.5169, -0.5960])
 \n\nJust check it out if you're curious. | tensor([ 8.0378, -1.9935, -1.5672, -2.4776, -0.8300, -0.5904, -2.1508, -0.7484])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
You won't regret it!   | tensor([ 8.5183, -2.1415, -2.3564, -2.9098,  0.1591, -1.4765, -1.7850, -0.9237])
Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well! | tensor([ 8.2072, -2.0856, -2.0359, -3.1968,  0.0571, -0.7102, -1.4031, -1.9098])
I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. | tensor([ 8.3174, -1.3522, -2.6093, -2.5731, -0.2807, -1.8876, -2.3881,  0.1044])
I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. | tensor([ 8.5477, -2.0064, -2.2556, -2.6382, -0.3698, -2.1294, -1.6945, -0.2605])
It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nThe shelter is great | tensor([ 2.6587, -0.7597,  0.6456, -3.3782, -1.6664, -2.7138,  0.7297,  3.2368])
and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. | tensor([ 8.5871, -2.0237, -2.2754, -2.2759, -0.2831, -2.0664, -1.6356, -0.8794])
Check this location out! | tensor([ 8.4449, -1.7607, -1.7151, -2.9911, -0.5351, -1.1234, -2.4751, -0.3303])
Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards. | tensor([ 8.6680, -2.0217, -2.2703, -2.5413, -0.1739, -2.0230, -1.6827, -0.9193])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! | tensor([ 8.4402, -1.5801, -1.9033, -2.2565, -1.1102, -1.0695, -1.9733, -0.9200])
At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !! | tensor([ 8.3215, -2.2708, -2.0724, -2.2498, -0.6087, -1.6318, -1.8546, -0.5336])
\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station. | tensor([ 8.2717, -1.6572, -2.2219, -2.4794, -1.2428, -2.4308, -0.8546, -0.1489])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations. | tensor([ 7.2802, -1.3623, -2.7177, -1.8331,  0.8783, -0.8007, -2.3424, -1.2847])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
These were both untrue statements.   | tensor([ 8.4101, -2.4227, -2.2068, -2.7590,  0.1874, -1.6938, -1.7071, -0.8170])
The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this. | tensor([ 5.5353, -2.2081, -2.9468, -0.0222,  2.1014, -0.9082, -3.1607, -0.2243])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.   | tensor([ 7.7112, -2.4472, -2.2950, -2.1473,  0.1897, -1.2227, -2.1578, -0.2805])
They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. | tensor([ 8.3969, -2.1521, -2.0826, -2.2884, -0.7536, -1.9708, -1.8981, -0.1503])
\n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records. | tensor([ 7.9881, -1.4045, -2.3506, -2.6454, -0.9821, -2.7844, -0.9181,  0.7124])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls | tensor([ 8.6059, -2.3225, -2.0618, -2.3732, -0.2783, -2.4106, -1.4280, -0.6086])
but this is your problem now. | tensor([ 8.5853e+00, -2.5747e+00, -2.0462e+00, -2.8502e+00, -1.4582e-04,
        -1.4798e+00, -1.4016e+00, -1.3685e+00])

They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better. | tensor([ 8.4658, -0.9795, -2.0914, -2.2199, -0.9424, -2.3063, -2.3896, -0.0954])

Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands. | tensor([ 8.2491, -0.9726, -2.3853, -2.1739, -0.7306, -2.4104, -2.1541,  0.0275])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.   | tensor([ 0.3488, -0.5628, -0.7137, -1.3510, -4.7466,  5.7641, -1.2578,  2.6684])
She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.   | tensor([ 7.0632, -2.9589, -1.5618, -2.0381, -1.2198, -1.2087,  1.0013, -2.1293])
After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat?? | tensor([ 7.8883, -1.1999, -2.6162, -0.2511, -1.1767, -3.2247, -1.9005,  0.1504])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance. | tensor([ 8.4174, -2.3153, -1.9493, -2.2802, -0.8461, -1.9452, -1.3657, -0.8499])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. | tensor([ 7.7439, -1.4368, -2.4573, -0.3371, -1.2989, -1.5679, -1.9275, -0.8492])
\n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter. | tensor([ 8.3526, -1.0355, -2.4100, -2.2919, -1.0855, -2.5453, -2.1025,  0.5349])

That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did. | tensor([ 8.2897, -1.6422, -2.3849, -2.4171, -0.5537, -1.9650, -1.9854, -0.1391])

Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI. | tensor([ 5.3669, -1.9081, -2.1175,  3.2476, -1.3582, -2.2425, -1.6986, -0.6608])

This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.   | tensor([ 2.0677, -0.6831, -2.5945,  7.3623, -1.6938, -2.0092, -1.7100, -1.2272])
It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life. | tensor([ 6.9463, -1.6716, -2.3351,  0.0302, -0.2532, -2.3726, -2.4082, -0.0578])

During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.   | tensor([ 8.5668, -1.6194, -2.5318, -2.7911, -0.1286, -2.4288, -1.5287, -0.3995])
Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting. | tensor([ 8.4664, -1.3534, -2.5809, -2.8676, -0.2867, -2.1946, -2.0066, -0.1161])

A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter). | tensor([ 8.3067, -1.1277, -2.9272, -2.0574, -0.0670, -2.5703, -2.1011, -0.1866])

I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.   | tensor([ 8.5422, -1.4173, -2.3990, -2.7028, -0.7541, -2.4907, -1.2679, -0.2152])
The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing. | tensor([ 8.5556, -1.5787, -2.6686, -2.7319, -0.0258, -2.2839, -2.0104,  0.0269])

In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly. | tensor([ 8.6285, -1.8607, -2.3222, -2.6196, -0.4120, -1.9245, -1.9500, -0.3015])

Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\n\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter. | tensor([ 8.5447, -1.7497, -2.2740, -2.9446, -0.4539, -2.2223, -1.5347, -0.4282])

I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok. | tensor([ 8.0557, -2.1051, -1.7997, -3.1580, -0.9949, -2.0737, -0.3414, -0.5725])

\"Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. | tensor([ 7.7648, -1.5232, -1.9986, -1.6674, -1.1970, -2.1739, -1.8040, -0.0151])

No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \"Would you like a moment before I take him?\" No \"I'm sorry.\" Nothing. | tensor([ 8.2905, -2.1733, -2.4684, -2.0352, -0.2053, -2.1230, -2.0665,  0.0149])
For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. | tensor([ 8.3474, -1.9744, -1.7099, -2.6872, -1.5677, -2.0715, -1.1894,  0.0411])

But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy. | tensor([ 8.4902, -2.3249, -1.7578, -1.8700, -0.7696, -2.3577, -1.4618, -1.0063])

\nThey kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs .\n\nThey kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter.\n\nMany volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer . \n\nWeak leadership. | tensor([ 8.2426, -2.5247, -1.9565, -2.5122, -1.1511, -1.8633, -0.0733, -1.2169])

It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill, unless you state you will take them back) cats because they are \"overcrowded.\"   | tensor([ 7.9606, -1.9132, -1.8926, -1.8354, -1.4562, -0.5887, -1.4644, -0.9963])

This place is PHENOMENAL.\nI got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take SUCH good care of the animals.   | tensor([ 0.4231,  0.1069, -2.3520, -1.9205,  7.7494, -0.5107, -2.4610, -0.1424])

Then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of 2/$10.\nI love my animals so much and I will always check here first for pets before anywhere else. | tensor([ 6.4321,  1.3111, -1.8367, -0.5830, -2.3235, -1.4474, -0.5074, -1.6448])
This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\n\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. | tensor([ 8.4625, -2.3582, -2.1115, -1.3008, -0.9604, -2.3564, -1.6323, -0.5909])

Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\n\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \"this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\": shelves are only about 4'6\" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\n\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile. | tensor([ 7.5453, -1.2479, -3.2397, -0.0429, -0.7051, -2.3957, -0.8126, -0.9555])

Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \"guilty-until-proven guilty\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.   | tensor([-0.9540,  1.3990, -2.6858,  0.0693, -0.6188, -0.6331,  4.5084, -0.4336])

I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers. | tensor([ 0.6480, -2.4464,  0.0166, -2.7475, -0.2536,  7.5662, -2.1785, -0.6862])

When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \"adventures\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill. | tensor([ 8.0701, -1.5106, -2.9533, -1.9344,  0.1081, -2.4652, -1.2286, -0.7523])

We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow. | tensor([ 8.5010, -1.6740, -2.4060, -2.6963, -0.5834, -2.1263, -1.7726,  0.0268])

Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up. | tensor([ 7.5681, -2.3869, -2.6425, -1.8924,  0.4230, -1.9321, -1.1940, -0.8595])

I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription. | tensor([ 7.9727, -2.3016, -2.0102, -2.0829, -1.3820, -1.6164, -0.4263, -0.7788])

But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment. | tensor([ 7.4492, -0.1740, -3.2491, -1.6327,  0.6628, -2.1436, -1.9205, -1.0340])
 \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior. | tensor([ 8.0622, -2.6977, -2.2875, -1.7905, -0.1817, -2.1700, -1.2022, -0.6558])

After searching around for a few minutes, they \"found\" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.   | tensor([ 3.2499, -0.0755, -3.4777, -2.6983,  5.9490, -1.9646, -2.8471,  1.7472])

Despite this being more conveniently located, Walgreens and Target end up getting most of my quick-shop business, simply due to late hours at night when I need to cook, clean, realize I'm out of toothpaste, have a headache, need a last-minute birthday card or whatever. | tensor([ 8.4163, -1.2829, -2.8205, -2.1012, -0.3121, -2.2322, -1.9105, -0.4672])

Furthermore, their own system sent me a confirmation email for my 5:30PM appointment. | tensor([ 8.6367, -2.1641, -2.2500, -2.5464, -0.2770, -2.1288, -1.3729, -0.8039])

He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work. | tensor([ 8.5771, -2.1462, -2.2009, -2.1882, -0.3714, -2.0206, -1.8232, -0.7040])

When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests\n\nWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. | tensor([ 8.3925, -2.5094, -1.9230, -2.1956, -0.7330, -2.0777, -1.2633, -0.6715])
When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. | tensor([ 8.4239, -1.7425, -2.0668, -2.5052, -0.8814, -2.1295, -1.2467, -0.6115])
Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. | tensor([-0.7224, -2.2126,  0.9719,  4.5987, -2.0275, -1.0215, -2.2352,  1.1747])

No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent. | tensor([ 7.6946, -0.3638, -2.7780, -3.0539, -1.3558, -1.2243, -1.0394,  0.5918])

They refused to start heat before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. | tensor([ 7.3521, -0.2482, -2.3632, -3.1144, -0.6375, -1.8690, -1.9652,  0.9864])

After the incident, I requested that the lock be changed immediately, and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not keeping our apartment as clean as when it had been leased to us. | tensor([ 8.4824, -1.8901, -2.5176, -2.6301, -0.1335, -2.4621, -1.6762,  0.1935])

Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. | tensor([ 7.1951, -2.5247, -1.0311, -2.1888, -1.2044, -0.3276, -1.8189, -0.9486])

It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\n\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. | tensor([ 7.4753, -2.3711, -2.4405, -1.7206, -1.0366, -0.2535, -1.9773, -0.0852])
They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\n\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\n\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. | tensor([ 8.3110, -2.1628, -2.3547, -1.6239, -1.0853, -1.5728, -1.8294, -0.3824])

local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist. | tensor([ 8.4213, -2.5613, -1.9347, -1.9891, -0.6600, -1.9043, -1.0782, -1.2344])
LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town, where time has stood still. | tensor([ 6.6092, -2.0680, -1.5426, -1.7012, -2.1520, -1.0731, -2.3636,  1.4466])
The art and small tables inside and outside are charming.\n2. | tensor([ 8.4568, -1.8764, -2.6993, -2.1084, -0.1379, -1.7615, -1.9309, -0.6094])

The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). | tensor([ 5.6710, -0.2681, -3.8279, -0.7536,  2.5183, -1.4311, -1.6254, -1.5835])
The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. | tensor([ 8.4063, -2.0805, -2.8465, -1.8203,  0.6223, -2.0950, -1.8048, -1.1263])
While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night... | tensor([ 8.6173, -1.9339, -2.3281, -1.7074, -0.5079, -2.4316, -1.9491, -0.4579])
I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours. | tensor([ 8.2743, -2.1056, -2.3713, -1.0015, -0.3782, -2.4174, -1.5216, -1.1348])
I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe. | tensor([ 8.5936, -1.4260, -2.6218, -2.0268, -0.5020, -2.6547, -1.8413, -0.2022])

I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. | tensor([ 8.6109, -1.7737, -2.5614, -2.1590, -0.2368, -2.4887, -1.8778, -0.3222])
Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again. | tensor([ 6.4383, -0.6449,  0.4989, -0.1512, -2.8580, -2.5005, -2.4932, -0.0123])

But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts. | tensor([ 8.6220, -2.1169, -2.3213, -1.9530, -0.3796, -2.1966, -1.7017, -0.8145])

Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.   | tensor([ 8.2913, -1.9251, -1.9597, -1.9965, -1.5310, -0.9640, -1.2625, -1.1588])
I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive. | tensor([ 7.9931, -1.4593, -1.1966, -1.4617, -1.9592, -1.5440, -2.1885, -0.5670])

If you make it to Highland Park, stop there and get some great neighborhood atmosphere. | tensor([ 3.1042, -1.1331, -2.4075, -2.3090, -2.4743,  4.7140, -1.4070,  1.1634])
I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it. | tensor([ 8.6548, -1.9173, -2.2955, -2.1365, -0.6561, -2.1664, -1.3434, -0.8789])
 \n\nEnrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.   | tensor([ 4.4085, -1.4729, -3.0997, -1.5189, -2.5745,  4.0040, -1.2767,  0.4724])
We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat. | tensor([ 7.6980, -2.2777, -1.3569, -1.3374, -1.3010, -1.2913, -1.8527, -0.4975])

and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.   | tensor([ 8.4525, -1.8228, -2.5195, -2.1597,  0.0725, -2.1556, -2.3520, -0.2544])
I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though. | tensor([ 8.4723, -2.1048, -2.2313, -2.2158, -0.5179, -2.2278, -2.2335,  0.1968])

I'll try it again and may change my review in the future. | tensor([ 8.6684, -2.1230, -2.1091, -2.3784, -0.6200, -1.7271, -1.7174, -0.7547])
 \n\nWhile I\"m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park. | tensor([ 8.1078, -1.9941, -2.4755, -2.4806, -1.4573, -1.0703, -1.6763,  0.3494])

Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior. | tensor([ 8.2118, -1.2399, -2.6960, -1.5759, -0.7228, -2.5129, -2.5196,  0.4845])

At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.\n\nIt's never too late. | tensor([ 8.5674, -2.2121, -2.0587, -2.1207, -0.6198, -1.9197, -1.4692, -0.9925])
I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had, in fact, I never even cared for them until trying Tazza D'oro's. | tensor([ 5.9135e+00, -2.1011e+00, -2.7851e+00, -4.8748e-03,  2.3797e+00,

I still hold their teas in high regard. | tensor([ 8.5741, -2.2099, -1.8309, -2.4635, -0.6349, -1.6324, -1.8769, -0.7864])
However, the food here sucks. | tensor([ 8.5195, -1.7658, -1.9589, -2.6288, -0.8410, -1.5177, -1.9606, -0.8308])
They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. | tensor([ 7.2630, -0.9271, -2.0724, -1.1932, -1.0949, -1.1440, -2.2365, -0.8868])

Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. | tensor([ 8.5524, -1.7980, -2.1860, -1.4484, -1.0320, -2.4938, -2.0491, -0.1898])
I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. | tensor([ 6.8136, -1.7935,  1.3854, -2.3455, -2.1208, -2.5040, -2.6265,  0.1487])
With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle? | tensor([ 6.9007, -2.5737, -1.6109, -2.9060, -1.0694,  2.0552, -1.4491, -1.1111])
Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review, but I guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business. | tensor([ 8.5940, -1.9872, -2.2824, -2.1836, -0.9797, -1.7721, -1.1392, -0.8932])

No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly. | tensor([ 8.0225, -1.6783, -1.8165, -0.9081, -1.5440, -0.6072, -2.0013, -1.5940])

I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee. | tensor([ 8.4869, -1.8547, -2.5010, -2.9829,  0.0816, -1.4625, -2.2958, -0.1409])

\n\nThe atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming. | tensor([ 8.5406, -2.1636, -2.3839, -1.8255, -0.4525, -2.2404, -1.5736, -0.8402])
 \n\nWhen it first opened (how long ago how?) | tensor([ 8.1332, -2.0784, -1.9683, -2.2734, -0.2184, -1.7387, -2.4301,  0.0466])
it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \"others\" who stopped by. | tensor([ 7.9294, -2.2915, -2.2739, -2.8434, -1.3169, -0.2040, -1.7031,  0.2818])

They've either relaxed or found other obsessions. | tensor([ 8.4498, -2.5169, -1.8941, -1.7266, -0.7585, -1.8969, -1.5894, -0.9689])

The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating. | tensor([ 8.4912, -2.5801, -2.2231, -2.2781, -0.2585, -1.7092, -1.3609, -1.1914])
 \n\nIt's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too! | tensor([ 7.0304, -1.4329, -2.1117, -1.7517, -0.4045, -0.2900, -2.3480, -0.5726])
Still one of the best places to get soy capps, but they no longer have an extensive tea list. | tensor([ 0.4740,  0.5815,  3.2599,  0.4454, -3.3867, -0.4655, -0.4998, -0.9174])
What's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea. | tensor([ 8.4040, -1.8736, -1.9706, -2.4237, -1.0901, -1.9638, -1.7676, -0.2566])
Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by U.S. Foods, or the like; nothing is local. | tensor([ 7.8172, -3.4132, -0.9635, -2.9784, -0.6976, -0.4585, -0.6124, -1.8656])
It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. | tensor([ 2.1304e+00, -2.1250e+00,  6.4524e+00, -2.6064e+00, -2.8200e+00,

Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service. | tensor([ 8.3878, -2.3838, -2.1516, -1.7829, -1.2705, -1.3736, -1.7202, -0.5640])
Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over). | tensor([ 8.1607, -2.0978, -2.3614, -2.3903, -0.2028, -1.5417, -2.1452, -0.1670])

I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well. | tensor([ 7.6768, -1.9633, -3.1206, -1.7362,  1.2378, -2.2133, -2.7528,  0.5040])
Verve and Olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices. | tensor([ 8.4229, -2.5945, -2.0317, -2.4167, -0.6428, -1.9758, -0.6905, -1.3043])

I had always meant to visit Enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.\n\nSo here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. | tensor([ 7.9433, -1.9431, -2.0321, -1.0668, -1.6964, -1.7666, -2.2012,  0.1472])
It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art | tensor([ 8.1730, -1.6087, -2.1483, -2.4307, -0.6649, -1.1826, -2.1517, -0.0976])
leaf.\n\nHere's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. | tensor([ 6.3393, -1.2999, -2.2194,  0.6449, -1.7384, -2.1273, -2.2788,  1.1407])
On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. | tensor([ 8.4041, -2.3886, -1.8336, -1.6523, -1.2066, -2.1966, -1.2863, -0.6793])
But the barista responded: \"No, you can't.\" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. | tensor([ 7.7406, -1.5474, -2.5313, -0.1821, -1.3072, -1.5794, -2.0678, -0.6423])

I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. | tensor([ 6.6135, -1.8922, -3.2390, -2.2064,  3.3375, -1.8307, -3.0768,  0.2897])
I just got it plain.\n\nI'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \"REAL\" cappuccino tasted like. | tensor([ 8.0806, -0.1929, -3.0510, -1.7473, -0.5380, -2.0765, -1.9822, -0.7827])

I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. | tensor([ 8.5984, -2.3494, -2.1596, -1.6508, -0.5365, -2.2229, -1.5459, -1.0505])
I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \"allowed\" to add them to your drink? | tensor([ 8.4634, -2.3754, -1.9196, -1.8794, -0.6545, -1.8547, -1.3637, -1.1385])
\n\nIt's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude. | tensor([ 8.4477, -1.8608, -1.7027, -2.5886, -0.9403, -1.6323, -1.2871, -1.1495])

Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. | tensor([ 8.3907, -2.1220, -1.9614, -2.2218, -0.3152, -1.5644, -2.3173, -0.7162])

It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 3.8841, -1.4141, -0.7982, -3.5705, -2.4998,  4.6229, -1.7561,  0.3353])
This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. | tensor([ 2.4870, -1.4034, -1.4014, -2.1430, -3.2199,  4.3131, -2.0358,  2.6310])
I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. | tensor([ 6.9980, -1.2553, -1.5377, -2.2112, -2.6850,  0.7051, -2.3569,  0.7528])
It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside. | tensor([ 4.2965, -2.1615, -1.7231, -0.5231,  1.0671, -1.1467, -3.1467,  1.3408])

So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was \"iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha\" over and over again. | tensor([ 8.5394, -2.1740, -2.2772, -1.7846, -0.7130, -1.9961, -1.6114, -0.7885])

one.\n\nSo I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there. | tensor([ 8.5539, -1.7110, -2.5590, -1.9705, -0.1350, -2.7012, -1.6133, -0.5738])

Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.\n\nSo why the 3 stars?   | tensor([ 8.6396, -2.0338, -2.3635, -1.8661, -0.2141, -2.5198, -1.6282, -0.8792])

I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.   | tensor([ 8.6900, -1.8604, -2.0666, -2.3955, -1.0664, -1.6380, -1.5829, -0.8498])

They bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. | tensor([ 8.5360, -1.3647, -2.4348, -1.8324, -1.0582, -2.4657, -1.8084, -0.2242])

It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos. | tensor([ 7.4691, -2.8090, -2.1008, -2.7346, -0.7934,  1.1834, -1.9760, -0.6251])

Upon receiving the salad I dug in.   | tensor([ 8.6162, -2.0263, -2.5304, -2.0881, -0.0275, -2.5434, -1.6562, -0.5875])
The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.   | tensor([ 8.0394, -1.6838, -2.8459, -3.0846,  0.8814, -0.9143, -1.9771, -1.1076])
However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad. | tensor([ 1.7722,  1.1092, -2.7476, -1.6631,  6.5915, -1.2155, -2.6025, -0.7115])

Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples. | tensor([ 7.5181, -1.0773, -2.0307, -3.2556, -0.5552, -1.9836, -1.8130,  0.7022])

She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left. | tensor([ 0.4467, -1.9753, -1.7992, -2.3814,  8.1735, -1.3224, -1.4312, -0.1020])

I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.   | tensor([ 8.1297, -1.0143, -2.6341, -2.2619,  0.0873, -2.3717, -1.8073, -0.5864])
It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.    | tensor([ 8.3523, -2.0324, -1.1944, -2.1580, -1.3038, -1.2651, -2.3989, -0.6737])
However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again. | tensor([ 8.3547, -1.5535, -2.7435, -3.1291,  1.3038, -2.5745, -1.5643, -0.4917])

It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential. | tensor([ 8.5829, -2.2666, -2.1283, -2.3464, -0.6996, -1.5399, -1.9154, -0.5629])
My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty \"meh\" experience for me. | tensor([ 7.9391, -0.5710, -2.9833, -2.7458,  0.0816, -1.9296, -2.6465,  0.8539])

We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought. | tensor([ 8.1890, -1.8776, -2.2144, -2.4282, -1.4058, -0.5404, -2.2068,  0.0150])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.   | tensor([ 3.4675, -0.8449, -3.2100,  3.3927,  1.7536, -2.1181, -1.0466, -2.3443])
The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp. | tensor([ 8.3083, -1.4954, -2.6833, -2.2767, -0.1082, -1.8870, -1.8043, -0.7917])

The sandwich left something to be desired. | tensor([ 8.5004, -2.2744, -2.4208, -2.3260,  0.2228, -1.8976, -1.7460, -0.9889])

It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich. | tensor([-0.8101,  0.0146,  0.8739,  6.1153, -0.5813, -1.6913, -2.1763, -2.0321])

The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy. | tensor([ 8.3698, -2.3878, -2.2932, -2.5960, -0.1042, -1.5817, -1.1705, -1.2651])

There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,   | tensor([ 8.6065, -1.6720, -2.3753, -2.3559, -0.7184, -1.5972, -2.0937, -0.5395])
It was just belly-filler, really. | tensor([ 8.2964, -1.4785, -1.9077, -2.6496, -1.0645, -1.1499, -2.4657,  0.1531])

I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here. | tensor([ 7.4916,  0.1349, -2.3493, -0.5668, -1.4082, -2.2968, -2.6630, -0.3168])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
\n\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8. | tensor([ 8.1411, -1.3557, -2.1284, -2.5237, -0.9746, -1.0330, -2.5670,  0.0450])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.   | tensor([ 7.0767, -1.0796, -2.6711, -2.2777,  0.1946, -0.1758, -2.1348, -0.7287])
Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.   | tensor([ 6.8757,  1.4347, -2.6259, -1.5380, -0.9264, -1.4783, -3.0683,  0.1430])
But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home. | tensor([ 6.7827,  1.5639, -2.6181, -2.3006, -0.4339, -1.6309, -2.8481,  0.1419])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Buffalo Blues was neither.\n\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason. | tensor([ 8.2194, -2.9528, -1.9128, -2.2433, -0.9432, -0.4637, -1.4506, -0.8891])
The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. | tensor([ 8.0395, -2.2798, -1.3167, -2.5049, -2.0667, -0.7131, -2.0792,  0.4388])
For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. | tensor([ 8.3629, -1.6504, -2.0032, -2.4890, -1.4587, -2.1709, -2.0734,  0.5008])
On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. | tensor([ 8.6859, -2.0953, -1.9985, -2.3289, -0.9780, -1.8324, -1.6142, -0.7681])
Seating is the only issue. | tensor([ 8.5591, -2.2192, -2.3540, -2.5702,  0.0940, -1.9933, -1.7878, -0.6445])
Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. | tensor([ 8.3841, -1.8174, -2.6843, -1.8006, -0.1544, -2.2520, -2.1230, -0.1790])
Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\n\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. | tensor([ 7.9991, -1.9182, -2.7326, -1.6398, -0.8007, -2.2697, -1.6611, -0.0278])
I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. | tensor([ 8.3820, -2.3881, -2.7400, -2.5466,  0.5921, -2.1156, -1.4277, -0.6156])
During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\n\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. | tensor([ 6.8353, -1.9572, -2.4625, -0.9522, -1.1218, -1.5288, -2.4133,  1.1761])
I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. | tensor([ 8.3792, -1.5463, -2.1470, -1.8701, -0.7945, -1.4356, -1.6632, -1.5725])
Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. | tensor([ 7.9240, -1.2403, -2.2973, -2.1116, -0.8260, -0.9977, -1.8743, -1.2064])
The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. | tensor([ 7.3636, -0.6564, -2.9613, -2.4689,  0.8142, -1.2893, -1.8937, -1.3153])
I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. | tensor([ 8.4836, -1.9745, -2.2179, -2.6483, -0.4278, -1.6063, -2.0119, -0.4047])
The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. | tensor([ 8.5128, -1.8874, -2.5280, -1.8444, -0.6820, -2.2015, -1.4807, -0.5996])
It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\n\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \"sports bar.\" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. | tensor([ 2.4282, -1.9064, -0.8184, -1.8731, -4.0433,  6.4364, -0.5480, -0.4084])
They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. | tensor([ 8.3273, -1.4434, -2.6431, -1.9461, -1.0635, -2.1460, -1.7648, -0.0160])
There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. | tensor([ 8.3863, -1.6712, -2.2901, -2.1286, -1.3736, -1.4756, -2.1030, -0.0108])
Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner. | tensor([ 8.3373, -1.7810, -2.3846, -1.7505, -1.2889, -2.0453, -2.2154,  0.3990])
So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected. | tensor([ 8.5191, -2.0079, -2.2641, -2.5970, -0.6604, -1.7248, -2.2514,  0.2503])

Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\n\nI'll start with the drinks. | tensor([ 8.0102, -1.8747, -2.7819, -1.3192, -0.1349, -1.9688, -2.6124,  0.0136])

They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM). | tensor([ 7.0842, -0.9329, -2.5147, -2.0307, -1.3147, -1.5073, -1.8643,  0.7089])
   | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it). | tensor([ 2.8539, -2.3527, -2.2427, -1.1866, -1.3677,  3.5140, -1.5046,  1.6065])

The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.   | tensor([ 3.9147, -3.4321, -1.4044, -2.6015,  0.5249,  5.1841, -1.8863, -1.9066])
Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble. | tensor([ 8.2191, -1.4210, -2.5758, -1.8432, -0.6527, -1.8233, -2.1515, -0.0842])

The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain. | tensor([ 4.7364,  0.4531, -2.8072,  2.3092, -1.7523, -2.7683, -1.9950,  0.5208])

One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\n\nI | tensor([ 8.0282, -1.4507, -2.2683, -1.0139, -0.6911, -2.0346, -2.2479, -0.9682])
know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars. | tensor([ 8.5874, -2.2493, -2.2131, -2.5282, -0.7213, -1.2577, -1.9587, -0.4335])

This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \"word versions\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us. | tensor([ 8.5152, -2.2585, -2.1207, -1.9164, -0.8596, -2.3671, -1.5238, -0.4516])
 \"A-OK,\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.   | tensor([ 8.3672, -2.2901, -2.4593, -1.9206, -0.4898, -1.7049, -1.9868, -0.1993])
The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.   | tensor([ 8.4486, -1.4692, -2.2341, -2.0856, -0.9391, -2.3906, -2.3744,  0.4445])
It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\n\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.   | tensor([ 8.5015, -0.8652, -2.4935, -2.1311, -1.0827, -2.3203, -2.0627,  0.1598])
Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life). | tensor([ 7.3625, -2.1014, -2.3140, -1.6424, -1.7857, -1.5968, -2.1835,  2.0481])

And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \"just fine.\"   | tensor([ 8.4407, -2.2117, -2.7909, -2.3418,  0.1146, -1.9795, -1.5709, -0.5528])
But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime. | tensor([ 8.6837, -2.0373, -1.7971, -2.4909, -0.8676, -1.8320, -2.0076, -0.4685])

I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. | tensor([ 2.0753, -1.8390, -2.8449,  1.1558, -2.0055,  0.5811, -0.5073,  1.9593])

The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night | tensor([ 1.5352, -2.4474, -0.1385, -2.7074, -3.4038,  6.9226, -1.2080,  0.8112])
but frankly I don't get it. | tensor([ 8.6491, -2.4212, -1.9858, -2.4433, -0.4065, -1.9112, -1.4708, -0.9454])
You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. | tensor([ 8.5654, -2.4959, -2.1057, -2.6070, -0.3955, -1.5685, -1.2407, -1.1586])
The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.   | tensor([ 8.5386, -2.1212, -2.5808, -2.5609, -0.1428, -2.1100, -1.2934, -0.5358])
So the max you could eat is 55 wings. | tensor([ 8.4620, -1.6585, -2.5705, -2.1623, -0.2046, -2.2437, -1.8946, -0.4506])
Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.   | tensor([ 8.0047, -0.7147, -2.5748, -0.9238, -1.9984, -1.9475, -1.4878, -0.3072])
They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch. | tensor([ 7.8936, -2.3770, -2.3534, -3.3083,  0.4756, -0.2544, -1.8093, -1.1944])

This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo. | tensor([ 8.4326, -2.4487, -1.9079, -2.9109, -0.6823, -1.3660, -1.4070, -0.4737])
 \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. | tensor([ 6.8298, -0.9626, -2.6146, -1.5062, -0.3284, -1.7902, -1.2615,  0.2707])
Apparently this was a bad choice.   | tensor([ 8.2931, -2.3663, -2.3912, -2.8594,  0.5820, -1.7759, -1.6641, -0.8675])
It took a full hour to get my food. | tensor([ 5.7089, -2.0076, -0.9731, -0.9055, -0.3832, -1.7161, -1.9092, -0.3737])
It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. | tensor([ 8.6496, -1.6432, -2.3176, -2.3444, -0.1767, -2.3040, -1.6608, -0.9108])
When my meal did arrive everything was cold. | tensor([ 8.6531, -1.8718, -2.1149, -2.4966, -0.6524, -1.9921, -1.9760, -0.4013])
The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave. | tensor([ 8.4115, -1.6765, -2.6375, -2.3800,  0.0454, -2.4223, -1.9162, -0.4083])

I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service. | tensor([ 8.5664, -1.2407, -2.3185, -1.9948, -1.0298, -1.9631, -2.1305, -0.4388])
Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. | tensor([ 7.8336, -1.8675, -1.6061, -3.0600, -1.1103, -2.0988, -2.3537,  1.4449])
My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. | tensor([ 8.5730, -1.7988, -2.4537, -1.8969, -0.8443, -2.0572, -2.1985,  0.0370])
The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. | tensor([ 6.2437, -2.7812, -1.8235, -1.3470,  0.9475, -1.0798, -1.6970, -0.7591])
As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. | tensor([ 7.3185, -2.4780, -2.7260, -0.8213,  1.7992, -1.8159, -1.9523, -1.3814])
We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service! | tensor([ 8.5026, -2.0914, -2.2413, -1.3115, -0.8443, -1.9104, -1.9905, -0.7133])
Loved the hot vegetarian sandwich. | tensor([ 5.7035,  0.2997, -2.7716, -0.2874,  0.2684, -2.0784, -3.5513,  0.4107])
Not easy to find veggie dishes which don't feel like a compromise. | tensor([-0.4163, -0.6282, -1.8604,  8.1681, -0.4544, -1.0652, -1.6171, -1.7954])
This was great. | tensor([ 8.5097, -2.0051, -2.2996, -2.5704, -0.0123, -1.7765, -2.2145, -0.4543])
Excellent service from waitress Ariella with the long black pony tail (don't know her last name). | tensor([ 1.1966, -1.0101, -2.8213, -2.0251,  6.6109,  1.3170, -2.5481, -0.6593])

Resonable prices. | tensor([ 8.5674, -2.3268, -2.1085, -2.5878, -0.4230, -1.7512, -1.5204, -0.9360])
I have a love-hate relationship with this place... | tensor([ 8.5467, -2.1793, -1.5062, -2.3960, -0.8191, -1.9715, -1.8744, -0.6484])

\n\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding. | tensor([ 6.7488,  0.5361, -2.8692, -1.5159,  0.0480, -2.8018, -3.0822,  0.7825])

I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.   | tensor([ 7.5646, -2.2529, -2.1401, -3.0555, -1.5574,  1.1647, -1.7735, -0.2994])
\n\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced. | tensor([ 8.4798, -1.9341, -2.0691, -2.0244, -0.9909, -2.0438, -1.7684, -0.5716])

The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.   | tensor([ 8.5005, -1.3397, -2.3263, -2.4482, -0.7710, -1.8673, -1.9305, -0.6944])
Not even a little bit. | tensor([ 8.3092, -1.9966, -2.3970, -3.1949, -0.0932, -1.0881, -2.2250, -0.0399])

The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings. | tensor([ 8.3192, -2.1016, -2.7663, -1.8325,  0.4396, -1.7377, -2.1943, -0.6768])

So, it's not really much of a win at all.   | tensor([ 8.5824, -1.8917, -2.1588, -2.2975, -0.5366, -1.6714, -2.2946, -0.3750])
Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.   | tensor([ 7.5336, -1.1461, -2.6285, -1.8373, -0.7579, -2.5720, -3.1740,  1.8571])
So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit. | tensor([ 8.6052, -2.1899, -1.8050, -1.9664, -1.1204, -1.7883, -1.9837, -0.6809])
I have mixed feelings about this place. | tensor([ 8.6272, -1.9577, -2.0155, -2.3494, -0.5108, -1.9218, -2.1195, -0.5092])

I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason. | tensor([ 8.4030, -1.7575, -2.1100, -2.3016, -0.7381, -2.0855, -2.3121,  0.2183])

It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan. | tensor([ 8.4371, -1.9785, -2.0133, -2.1933, -1.2263, -2.1447, -2.0271,  0.1717])

Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans. | tensor([ 8.5783, -2.2348, -1.9810, -2.4595, -1.3283, -1.2443, -1.5985, -0.4853])

The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.   | tensor([ 8.5132, -1.7089, -2.3330, -2.0666, -0.7025, -1.8408, -2.1198, -0.4175])
That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar. | tensor([ 7.9733, -1.0258, -2.5519, -1.3352, -0.6139, -2.4624, -2.8850,  0.2412])

The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays). | tensor([ 7.7638, -2.1091, -1.4959, -0.6521, -1.6525, -0.6283, -1.2982, -2.0604])

That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced. | tensor([ 8.0769, -1.1042, -2.9947, -1.3595, -0.3704, -2.6554, -1.3728, -0.8813])

When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day. | tensor([ 8.4942, -1.6456, -2.6681, -2.4885,  0.0112, -2.2126, -2.0838, -0.2905])

In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.   | tensor([ 8.3368, -2.1076, -1.8910, -1.1023, -1.0808, -2.4225, -1.5162, -1.0734])
They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.   | tensor([ 0.2677, -0.9217, -1.7485,  8.1300, -0.9571, -1.2518, -1.6105, -1.8401])

They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.   | tensor([ 6.9250, -1.7130, -2.5235, -2.2266,  2.4539, -0.7969, -2.0713, -2.0042])

The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. | tensor([ 4.8435, -0.6907, -2.3721, -2.1823, -0.4759, -1.3935, -3.4780,  3.8042])
I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. | tensor([ 8.6133, -2.2468, -1.9536, -1.6970, -1.0870, -2.1515, -1.7607, -0.6254])
It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. | tensor([ 7.8637, -1.7833, -2.6341, -2.8501,  0.6540, -1.3063, -2.2065, -0.3595])

I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- | tensor([ 8.3970, -1.8173, -2.6467, -2.3644,  0.1104, -2.6979, -2.0626,  0.6084])

Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. | tensor([ 8.5928, -2.2160, -2.1673, -2.8619, -0.7995, -1.2284, -1.8078, -0.2774])

My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. | tensor([ 8.4786, -1.9630, -2.2121, -2.3043, -0.5961, -2.1608, -2.1635,  0.1788])
Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. | tensor([ 4.7872, -2.5335, -2.5591, -1.6360,  4.8699, -2.1379, -1.1749, -1.6887])
Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. | tensor([ 8.2425, -2.2535, -2.5615, -3.1509,  0.9449, -2.3329, -1.6760,  0.0296])
We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. | tensor([ 2.3717, -1.4287, -2.9211, -1.6077,  7.8192, -1.8178, -2.4518, -0.2451])
Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. | tensor([ 8.3053, -2.3463, -2.2286, -2.4287,  0.4433, -1.6211, -1.8674, -0.9868])

I also like to come here before I go grocery shopping at the nearby Trader Joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.\n\nAll of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, I haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. | tensor([ 5.2383, -1.2712, -1.9266, -1.0759, -0.6563,  2.4489, -1.7026, -1.9208])

Certainly this is not a big box store, but, honestly, I wouldn't give my pets 99% of the food, treats, or toys that can be found in those stores, so, really, Smiley's offers me a better selection of what I actually want than any big box does. | tensor([ 8.3645, -1.4478, -2.4120, -2.0428, -0.8568, -2.0568, -1.7009, -0.4757])

We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. | tensor([ 8.6979, -1.9973, -2.1824, -2.4157, -0.4344, -2.4010, -1.5759, -0.5869])
I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us. | tensor([ 8.5895, -2.4150, -2.0003, -2.3761, -0.5864, -2.1225, -1.1822, -1.0392])
I had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when I went to pay, the guy at the register actually says something to the effect of \"Do you have any idea what this is supposed to cost? | tensor([ 8.0964, -1.4293, -2.4579, -3.2177, -0.3801, -1.0887, -1.2390, -1.0025])
So, I could charge you $400 and you wouldn't know the difference?\" Joking or not, why even go there? | tensor([ 8.4116, -2.1308, -2.2669, -1.9199, -0.7285, -2.3919, -1.7294, -0.1445])
Made an appointment for 3:30. | tensor([ 8.5527, -2.1952, -2.0982, -2.3893,  0.1035, -2.0444, -1.9261, -0.8287])
They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. | tensor([ 8.5854, -1.7005, -2.2212, -2.7439, -0.6650, -2.3905, -1.8657,  0.2083])
Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. | tensor([ 8.5863, -2.1821, -2.2685, -2.6959,  0.0845, -2.1051, -1.8842, -0.3257])
They said it would take another two hours to start work. | tensor([ 8.2546, -2.5131, -1.3808, -2.7702, -0.5990, -1.2568, -1.4729, -0.9778])
Completely unhelpful and unapologetic. | tensor([ 7.3973, -0.9995, -3.0920, -0.8297,  0.3322, -1.5724, -2.0897, -1.2810])
I came in with a flat.   | tensor([ 8.5385, -2.0003, -2.3029, -2.6734, -0.0290, -2.2890, -1.8309, -0.2277])
They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges. | tensor([ 8.2562, -1.6617, -2.2326, -3.1019, -0.7143, -0.6632, -1.5262, -0.4017])

True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.   | tensor([ 8.1301, -1.7226, -2.4551, -3.2029, -0.0231, -0.4301, -2.1522, -0.6504])
The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\n\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.   | tensor([ 8.6132, -1.8521, -2.4683, -2.4343, -0.3555, -2.0017, -1.7186, -0.4329])
Hmmm....   | tensor([ 8.2333, -1.8468, -2.2977, -2.7274,  0.0683, -1.3282, -2.3387, -0.3082])
How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous. | tensor([ 8.3858, -2.1640, -1.8433, -2.3048, -1.1558, -1.7064, -0.7748, -1.1467])

My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied). | tensor([ 8.5610, -1.8510, -2.4220, -2.7231, -0.0815, -2.2289, -1.7392, -0.4467])

Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480. | tensor([ 8.5170, -1.4258, -2.3341, -2.9149, -0.5301, -1.6292, -1.8705, -0.6055])

How did I know they were crappy? | tensor([ 8.5537, -1.5271, -2.1600, -2.3938, -0.6453, -1.9493, -2.2715, -0.2691])

I looked them up online. | tensor([ 8.6304, -2.1389, -2.0995, -2.5158, -0.4032, -2.0414, -1.6805, -0.5790])

Guess what else I found. | tensor([ 8.1924, -2.1835, -2.0270, -2.9989, -0.2606, -1.2388, -2.1510, -0.0525])

Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal! | tensor([ 8.4135, -1.7723, -2.2954, -3.2733, -0.2046, -2.1132, -1.3287, -0.3297])
 \n\nSo | tensor([ 8.3959, -2.4283, -2.2720, -2.7234,  0.3763, -1.6638, -1.6821, -0.9429])
no, no thank you. | tensor([ 8.4825, -2.1641, -2.3935, -2.5905,  0.0960, -1.7139, -1.9948, -0.6238])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\n\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.   | tensor([ 8.6186, -1.6450, -2.4087, -2.4674, -0.4388, -1.9030, -2.0431, -0.3537])
They fixed the flat no problem for $20.   | tensor([ 8.3209, -1.5157, -2.3100, -2.5911, -0.7137, -1.4907, -1.7937, -0.3091])
Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all. | tensor([ 8.4476, -1.8628, -2.1797, -2.4749, -0.5375, -2.4099, -1.2802, -0.3379])
I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. | tensor([ 8.6042, -1.9221, -2.2647, -1.8261, -0.5078, -2.3789, -1.9139, -0.4028])
\nThey removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and \"without\" charging me labor. | tensor([ 8.3667, -2.0941, -2.5836, -1.1642, -0.7191, -2.1031, -1.7412, -0.4876])
\nI may not know much about cars | tensor([ 8.4477, -2.0262, -2.1755, -2.2204, -0.5075, -1.6817, -2.0152, -0.5883])
but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. | tensor([ 8.4123, -2.0097, -2.0612, -1.9717, -0.7161, -1.6976, -2.1730, -0.4803])
I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). | tensor([ 8.6111, -2.0723, -2.0893, -2.5442, -0.3037, -1.9955, -1.8934, -0.5652])
\n\nI also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. | tensor([ 7.3215, -1.1670, -3.0746, -1.2310, -1.1094, -0.9035, -1.5409, -0.2270])
You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. | tensor([ 5.7451, -0.3794,  0.3851, -3.7994, -1.6272, -0.3378, -2.4870,  0.9501])
It may save you $100's.\n\nThis place will rob you blind.\n\nNever have work done in a place like this until you do your homework! | tensor([ 7.5922, -1.8061, -2.6795,  0.3678, -1.0847, -2.1793, -1.6825, -0.5054])
I knew I needed new tires and an alignment | tensor([ 8.6981, -2.1366, -2.2411, -2.9092, -0.2228, -1.8958, -1.3665, -0.9105])
so I ordered the tires ahead so I could be in-and-out as quickly as possible to make it to class. | tensor([ 6.4904,  0.1695, -3.5139, -2.5813,  0.9520, -2.6299, -2.2911,  2.4720])
Showed up noone had ordered the tires but they said they'd split the difference of a different brand. | tensor([ 8.6623, -2.1313, -2.1716, -2.6421, -0.1990, -1.8790, -1.7315, -0.8860])
I was a little irritated but agreed and thought this was going to be a bad decision coming here (I'm from out of town); however, I was pleasantly surprised by the service. | tensor([ 8.7101e+00, -2.2952e+00, -2.1740e+00, -2.4651e+00, -5.4720e-04,
        -2.2974e+00, -1.7096e+00, -7.3948e-01])
The mechanics noticed the car's bushings were what was causing the problems it took awhile and they offered a little extra discount which was much appreciated. | tensor([ 8.5602, -1.7581, -2.3583, -2.3227, -0.2475, -1.7738, -1.8779, -1.0319])
Overall, it took 2 and 1/2 hours, had front aligned, bushings replaced, two new tires, and an oil change....cost $606. | tensor([ 8.4889, -1.5367, -2.3652, -3.2442, -0.0634, -1.5294, -1.6755, -0.8855])
So, I still believe it was a little pricey but the guys were great and I can definitely note an overall difference in my car. | tensor([ 8.7038, -1.8676, -2.4213, -2.5963, -0.0088, -2.0722, -1.9514, -0.6171])
I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections. | tensor([ 8.1798, -1.1460, -1.8698, -2.9504, -1.4084, -1.0344, -2.2899, -0.1469])

First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.   | tensor([ 8.3355, -1.8121, -2.7378, -2.9952, -0.3077, -1.8478, -1.5667,  0.3203])
Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off. | tensor([ 8.5446, -2.0012, -2.3467, -2.3359, -0.4649, -2.1378, -1.6851, -0.3957])
  I was quoted $425 for them to get it off. | tensor([ 8.5642, -1.8080, -2.0062, -2.8767, -0.6696, -1.8695, -1.9552, -0.0118])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar. | tensor([ 7.7973, -1.8685, -1.4965, -3.1507, -1.2349, -1.3683, -2.2359,  1.0132])
 \n\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge). | tensor([ 8.4758, -2.0354, -2.3984, -3.0116,  0.1663, -2.1232, -1.5087, -0.6270])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on. | tensor([ 8.4719, -2.3139, -1.6688, -2.4069, -0.6221, -2.0257, -1.3132, -0.9933])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.   | tensor([ 8.6515, -2.1459, -2.1348, -2.1697, -0.5363, -2.2773, -1.8116, -0.4722])
They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud. | tensor([ 8.6115, -2.1208, -2.0799, -2.6120, -0.5600, -1.8826, -1.7800, -0.4083])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool. | tensor([ 8.5772, -0.7268, -2.5253, -2.8461, -0.5979, -1.9971, -1.8409, -0.1783])
 \n\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs. | tensor([ 8.5773, -2.3590, -2.0113, -2.0653, -0.7024, -2.2161, -0.9980, -1.2636])
 Avoid this shop. | tensor([ 8.5801, -2.5188, -2.2537, -2.7767,  0.2927, -1.8306, -1.3813, -1.2446])
Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front | tensor([ 2.0413, -0.1310, -3.2223,  2.2858, -2.2503,  0.7193, -1.6533,  2.0097])
so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. | tensor([ 8.6635, -2.1092, -2.3837, -2.6641, -0.1386, -2.1475, -1.6781, -0.3067])
But after what happened I will never be back. | tensor([ 8.6427, -2.0041, -1.9237, -2.4105, -0.7917, -1.9907, -2.2701, -0.0382])
They just cost me money and lost my tires. | tensor([ 8.5830, -2.1082, -2.0490, -3.0231, -0.7871, -1.6314, -1.3856, -0.6636])
\n\nIn March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. | tensor([ 8.0901, -1.8641, -1.6734, -3.0261, -0.9647, -0.4788, -2.1969, -0.8038])
The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. | tensor([ 8.5946, -1.4053, -2.4351, -2.5959, -0.6769, -2.2628, -2.2794,  0.2687])
Put the tires in my basement, no problem. | tensor([ 8.4820, -1.6706, -2.3386, -3.0665, -0.5380, -1.8585, -1.6108, -0.2196])
Saved for a rainy day. \n\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable | tensor([ 8.3465, -1.3694, -2.4927, -2.5379, -0.7735, -2.0075, -2.1402,  0.3949])
so I had to get it replaced. | tensor([ 8.5949, -2.3009, -2.0026, -2.5084, -0.3842, -1.7255, -2.0247, -0.3847])
Luckily I've got a spare! | tensor([ 8.4128, -1.5584, -2.5855, -3.1250,  0.2022, -1.7114, -2.1291, -0.2941])
I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in | tensor([ 8.5738, -2.6535, -1.9272, -2.2337, -0.7184, -1.8277, -1.2440, -0.7923])
but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. | tensor([ 8.3480, -2.4203, -1.4142, -2.8145, -0.6487, -1.3121, -1.5979, -1.0546])
I needed my car | tensor([ 8.0938, -1.9314, -2.6997, -2.8984,  0.5647, -1.5155, -2.1767, -0.0134])
so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). | tensor([ 8.6106, -1.5805, -2.2257, -2.2861, -0.8354, -2.3017, -1.2288, -1.0267])
\n\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. | tensor([ 3.1808,  3.3635, -2.1899, -2.1817, -0.8535, -1.8217, -1.8251,  2.7667])
They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. | tensor([ 8.3552, -1.1753, -2.0552, -3.4424, -0.7603, -0.9703, -2.1389,  0.0177])
Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. | tensor([ 8.7023, -2.2439, -1.9435, -2.3383, -0.9640, -1.7227, -1.5346, -0.8786])
So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. | tensor([ 8.6585, -1.7949, -2.0049, -2.7647, -0.7902, -1.6902, -2.1068, -0.2796])
The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. | tensor([ 8.6420, -1.8594, -2.1769, -2.8634, -0.1659, -2.0501, -2.0412, -0.2919])
\n\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. | tensor([ 8.5328, -1.7205, -2.1658, -2.5252, -0.7891, -2.1146, -1.8604,  0.0277])
They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \"would work with me\". | tensor([ 8.7428, -1.7025, -2.0778, -2.1969, -0.9655, -2.1773, -1.5969, -0.9483])
Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? | tensor([ 8.6235, -2.1299, -2.2028, -2.6646, -0.3962, -2.1415, -1.2908, -0.7630])
Not worth chancing. | tensor([ 8.4910, -2.3272, -2.4572, -2.6080,  0.0814, -1.7876, -1.5796, -0.8664])

The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). | tensor([ 0.7413, -3.1618,  7.1232, -2.4008, -1.7723, -0.5277, -2.6698,  0.6359])

I have to be honest, my first trip in here I felt like taking my escalator down into the pit that is AAA was equivalent to taking a trip into the fifth ring of hell. | tensor([ 8.6092, -1.8886, -2.0363, -2.0752, -0.9674, -2.4216, -1.5241, -0.4118])

Both times I had business here, I was in and out in less than a half hour- which was far better than the marathon nightmare I was expecting. | tensor([ 8.5708, -1.8167, -2.3308, -2.3275, -1.0052, -2.0109, -1.7236, -0.0604])
I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. | tensor([ 8.6437, -2.1084, -2.1999, -2.4400, -0.7277, -1.9396, -1.8950, -0.1815])
\n\nThe agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.\n\nAlso, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. | tensor([ 8.4354, -2.3372, -2.6357, -2.7065,  0.5994, -2.0678, -1.2157, -0.9022])

As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 8.5377, -1.8518, -2.4364, -2.0336, -0.4496, -1.7890, -2.0283, -0.5648])

ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. | tensor([ 8.4681, -2.3386, -2.1227, -1.9839, -0.2931, -2.5820, -2.1513,  0.1715])
$4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. | tensor([ 3.5602,  2.4652, -3.4488,  1.0476, -0.1916, -3.4327, -2.9203,  2.4454])
we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. | tensor([ 6.5837, -2.2949, -2.2955,  1.6750, -0.3441, -2.7368, -1.3065, -1.7116])
by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.\ni liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? | tensor([ 8.2140, -1.5655, -2.9031, -1.2416, -0.7000, -2.4288, -1.8434, -0.0285])

Geez... way to be behind the times Rachel!\n\nI've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. | tensor([ 8.7117, -1.7525, -2.2118, -2.3138, -0.4523, -2.4041, -1.7902, -0.6179])

It was definitely better than just house.\n\nThey have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a \"club.\" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. | tensor([ 7.8056, -1.1401, -2.9960, -2.3875, -1.2652, -1.5040, -1.9237,  1.1369])

I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.\n\nAll of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. | tensor([ 7.8938, -1.1265, -2.6095, -2.8290,  0.6859, -2.2495, -0.6057, -1.5263])
Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.\n\nThey even cut keys that actually work. | tensor([ 8.2751, -2.1673, -2.0786, -1.7035, -1.1526, -1.3896, -1.2290, -1.0273])

yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.\n\nAfter someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt. | tensor([ 1.4347, -0.7193, -2.7213, -2.3938,  8.4400, -1.3528, -1.6280, -0.5018])

However, a staff member helped us use other tile and decorative pieces to compliment the tile we already had, instead of schlepping all the way to Monroeville to pick up the tile up were originally looking for. | tensor([ 8.3214, -2.3373, -1.9694, -2.2773, -0.9070, -1.0492, -1.6534, -0.5090])

I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\n\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that. | tensor([ 8.5945, -1.6089, -2.5437, -2.8019, -0.4801, -1.7821, -1.7521, -0.0395])

\n\nIt's a big-box home improvement store, for better or worse. | tensor([ 3.3545,  2.8564, -3.5196,  0.6505, -1.4132, -1.6457,  0.7075, -0.7022])

\n\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. | tensor([ 4.6126, -0.6634, -2.4985, -2.9754, -0.0098, -0.6951,  3.0487, -2.8090])

I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\n\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. | tensor([ 8.6404, -1.9830, -2.0367, -1.8436, -0.8959, -2.4288, -1.3066, -1.0077])
There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)! | tensor([ 7.9140, -1.5256, -2.3693, -0.3987, -1.5274, -2.1028, -1.9891, -0.5056])

They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. | tensor([ 8.6084, -1.9844, -1.7784, -2.4310, -1.1820, -2.0122, -1.8840, -0.2570])
\n\nThat's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house. | tensor([ 3.7561,  0.3544, -1.7706, -2.8433, -1.4433,  0.2791,  2.0757, -2.2204])
Some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank. | tensor([ 8.1634, -2.0399, -1.7328, -2.4486, -1.2922, -1.2620, -0.7497, -1.4175])

\n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.   | tensor([ 2.4629,  1.6790, -3.1211, -1.0700,  0.6913, -2.0638,  0.9093,  0.3205])

It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death. | tensor([ 8.6547, -2.1652, -1.7795, -2.4127, -0.9010, -2.1256, -1.7174, -0.5013])

Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.   | tensor([ 8.5562, -1.9613, -2.2877, -2.2198, -0.2773, -1.9804, -1.9768, -0.5650])

The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.\n\nThe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.\n\nIn the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!). | tensor([ 8.1670, -1.2730, -2.7444, -1.3616, -1.1339, -2.2634, -1.7618,  0.0443])

It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals). | tensor([ 8.3653, -1.2745, -2.2248, -2.8257, -0.4194, -1.6104, -2.3493, -0.1510])

We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item. | tensor([ 8.6169, -2.1981, -1.9982, -2.2505, -0.6002, -1.8696, -1.7116, -0.8437])
I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. | tensor([ 8.1704, -2.2796, -2.4890, -2.2137, -0.5268, -1.3204, -1.5789,  0.0315])

The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.\n\nI really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. | tensor([ 8.3016, -1.8757, -2.1834, -1.6524, -1.5314, -2.0948, -1.9244,  0.6444])

The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. | tensor([ 8.3653, -1.5543, -2.4963, -2.2546, -0.1291, -2.2929, -2.2373, -0.2628])
I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay. | tensor([ 0.8106,  0.0684,  3.3162, -1.0322, -1.8736, -0.8767, -1.2924, -0.2938])

The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. | tensor([ 6.8023, -2.0915, -0.0857, -2.3726, -1.5267,  0.7583, -1.5214, -1.9551])
The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. | tensor([ 8.3166, -2.3800, -1.8511, -2.5092, -1.5379, -0.9109, -1.5840, -0.3240])
\n\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone. | tensor([ 8.6169, -2.2769, -2.0600, -2.2855, -0.6883, -2.1291, -1.8679, -0.1421])

There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. | tensor([ 8.0098, -0.7448, -2.1872, -2.0564, -0.2493, -1.0026, -2.7392, -1.0325])

The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \"we don't have those anymore\" or \"no, we can't cook wings dry.\" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated. | tensor([ 1.2036,  0.3951, -2.9865, -0.0554,  5.5874, -1.9640, -1.2155, -1.2098])

I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.   | tensor([ 8.6778, -2.2033, -2.2395, -2.3511, -0.2261, -2.4380, -1.4386, -0.7517])
Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it. | tensor([ 8.3620, -1.5121, -2.6697, -1.9424, -0.4962, -2.0159, -2.2564, -0.1391])

It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. | tensor([ 7.6508, -1.0003, -2.4758, -1.9678, -0.0533, -2.0038, -2.4945, -0.3900])

It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).\n\nAs the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). | tensor([ 8.2059, -1.4744, -2.4312, -2.4065, -0.2875, -1.3656, -2.0073, -1.0430])

I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs. | tensor([ 8.0609,  0.2619, -2.6070, -3.7331,  0.4237, -2.3617, -1.9628,  0.1107])

I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.   | tensor([ 5.4570,  0.0886, -2.3906, -1.1985,  0.3258,  0.7876, -0.7390, -2.2190])

Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review). | tensor([ 6.3059, -1.1803, -1.8608, -3.6008, -1.6085,  2.2878, -0.4825, -1.2398])

So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere. | tensor([ 8.0229, -1.3752, -2.2307, -2.6886, -2.0963, -1.2520, -1.0639,  0.0742])

Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores. | tensor([ 7.5963, -1.8096, -1.4671, -1.8427, -1.5174, -1.8406, -0.3839, -1.5069])

I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\n\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \n\nThere are a few good points, though. | tensor([ 4.8062,  0.2878, -1.2902, -1.8088, -2.3520, -0.4792, -0.2470,  0.1822])

Whole paycheck is a fitting name.\n\nThis Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late. | tensor([ 8.4242, -1.6647, -2.2895, -2.0707, -0.8465, -2.0446, -1.4237, -0.9472])

\n\nI used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.\n\nWhole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. | tensor([ 8.4959, -1.6749, -2.2018, -2.4869, -0.7100, -1.7404, -1.4816, -0.8924])

Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! | tensor([ 8.2047, -1.8535, -2.6310, -3.0199,  1.3324, -2.2459, -1.7252, -0.5354])
$135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). | tensor([ 8.0398, -1.7245, -2.6995, -2.8459, -0.0693, -1.9506, -1.5828,  0.3544])
This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience. | tensor([ 8.5650, -2.1140, -2.0421, -2.4465, -0.7965, -1.9886, -1.1316, -1.0446])

I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a little high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. | tensor([ 6.9101, -0.1436, -1.2777, -2.0928, -2.4336, -0.9570, -1.4975, -0.4927])

If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.\n\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars. | tensor([ 8.4019, -1.4172, -2.6777, -1.6948, -0.4390, -2.4208, -1.8545, -0.4834])

Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.   | tensor([ 8.1595, -2.0048, -2.2247, -2.2474, -0.7190, -1.8247, -1.3645, -0.7176])

 \"We have it,\" said Cashier #1. | tensor([ 6.3362, -2.3558, -2.5238, -2.4057,  0.8398, -0.9153,  0.3805, -2.2388])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
\"It's probably just under \"Whole Foods.\"\"  \"We have it,\" said Cashier #2, \"but I don't know the password - ask customer service.\"  \"We don't have it,\" said Customer Service, \"go to Starbucks.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, Starbucks is letting me drink my coffee & eat my vegan cookie and didn't make me buy anything.\n\nNO WI-FI. | tensor([ 8.1527, -2.4555, -2.3343, -2.5363,  0.2658, -1.8540, -0.7993, -1.5753])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Otherwise, this Whole Foods is pretty good. | tensor([ 8.5909, -2.2408, -2.1415, -2.5636, -0.2888, -1.9891, -1.5526, -0.8232])
I love shopping here. | tensor([ 6.7875, -0.3610, -1.7110, -2.8236, -0.1765, -1.1303, -3.5395,  1.1377])
The staff is really nice, no attitudes. | tensor([ 8.7447, -1.9532, -2.3041, -2.5569, -0.3865, -2.2482, -1.2288, -1.0500])
Even the other shoppers are kind. | tensor([ 7.9751, -2.4761, -2.4753, -2.4003, -0.0152, -0.9450, -1.9065, -0.7219])
It's always nice. | tensor([ 7.2895, -1.3953, -1.9975, -2.3996, -1.0420,  0.2316, -3.1934,  0.4580])
Thanks to everyone for making Whole Foods a nice shopping experience. | tensor([ 8.4562, -2.0462, -2.0067, -2.2337, -0.2209, -1.8030, -1.6329, -1.3288])
I loved it, parking and all, after all, they had Palak Paneer! | tensor([-0.5344, -1.3901,  3.3145, -0.3615, -4.6054,  3.5340, -2.0300,  2.3985])
It was tasty. | tensor([ 8.4160, -2.2053, -1.8523, -2.3863, -0.5132, -1.3344, -2.2486, -0.6453])
I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. | tensor([ 8.2494, -1.3604, -2.6225, -2.2981, -0.6806, -2.0232, -2.3827,  0.4640])
the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. \n\nEver have whoopsies after green Indian cuisine?\n\nIt's off my list now. | tensor([ 0.9725, -3.6053,  2.1221, -1.9815, -2.2124,  6.4624, -1.1767, -1.3404])
This store is great - it's got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends, but isn't a vast, overpowering warehouse. | tensor([ 8.1845, -1.0835, -2.7616, -2.5994, -0.8388, -1.7679, -0.9617, -0.3775])
Items are well organized, and easy to find. | tensor([ 8.4132, -2.3540, -1.9147, -2.2307, -0.7373, -1.6764, -1.8082, -0.4052])
As others' state, it ain't cheap! | tensor([ 8.0100, -1.8514, -2.0666, -3.0114, -0.8427, -0.5360, -1.1093, -1.3102])
\n\nOne way we lowered our Whole Foods bill was to go for their 365 in-house brand, which is typically priced at the same pricepoint as similar items in the regular chain grocery stores. | tensor([ 7.7811, -2.3239, -1.6517, -1.7076, -1.2276, -1.7461,  0.0822, -2.1542])
We don't use Whole Foods for all of our supermarket needs, just the specialty items, great produce, and seafood.\n\nI docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep. | tensor([ 8.5898, -1.7483, -2.4720, -2.3810, -0.5126, -2.0668, -1.2405, -0.9292])
I know that's harsh, but every time we come here, we need to factor in another 10-15 minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely (there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave, and so we often can't just pull out of the space and leave quickly...) | tensor([ 8.2645, -1.7838, -2.1526, -1.3935, -1.3766, -2.2475, -1.7375, -0.2758])
Even being careful, we have almost been hit multiple times by people losing their cool with the terrible parking.\n\nThat being said, we will continue to come here to stock our home when we plan to entertain at home. | tensor([ 8.4792, -2.3073, -1.8384, -1.7106, -1.4176, -1.9447, -1.5264, -0.7766])
I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. | tensor([ 3.5325, -0.9008, -0.6163, -0.9750, -4.0977,  1.0934,  2.4255, -1.9129])
It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. | tensor([ 8.0759, -1.1905, -2.9241, -1.6827, -0.8074, -2.4080, -2.3245,  0.8694])
And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium \"natural\" goods. | tensor([ 8.3651, -1.6801, -2.1791, -2.3939, -0.8598, -1.9691, -1.3416, -0.7951])
Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. | tensor([ 8.1638, -1.7678, -2.0440, -1.4389, -1.2542, -2.3360, -1.3847, -0.8295])
The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. | tensor([ 6.8888,  0.5827, -2.9370, -0.7788, -1.6061, -2.2483, -1.3867, -0.6376])
And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link! | tensor([ 8.5648, -2.1097, -2.5509, -2.7431,  0.7109, -2.2615, -1.3913, -0.9079])
This store is pretty good. | tensor([ 8.5574, -2.2681, -2.0916, -2.6593, -0.4488, -1.3046, -2.0104, -0.5671])
Yes it is fairly expensive | tensor([ 8.5135, -1.9416, -2.1319, -2.5174, -0.4623, -1.6242, -2.1400, -0.5270])
but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. | tensor([ 8.1969, -2.2065, -2.0343, -2.0592, -0.8659, -1.1026, -1.9796, -0.4662])
They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products, particularly beef. | tensor([ 5.2065, -1.7288, -0.8414, -3.7823, -0.6522,  3.4328, -1.2703, -2.1215])
We've been very happy with their produce, which we find noticeably better than Trader Joe.\n\nI wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection (we are used to the larger stores in Chicago). | tensor([-0.2594, -1.7266, -0.0902, -2.4713, -3.0702,  8.2115, -0.3039, -0.2852])
Also wish there was a liquor department | tensor([ 8.5745, -2.1573, -2.3640, -2.1571, -0.1346, -2.2011, -2.0357, -0.3903])
but I'll probably have to run for state office for that. | tensor([ 8.4658, -2.1006, -2.2477, -2.5343, -0.3385, -1.4967, -1.9911, -0.5297])
Frankly the worst part is often parking. | tensor([ 4.6617, -1.1272, -2.3699, -1.4537, -1.0093,  0.2499, -0.6263, -0.0687])
Don't know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot (myself included) but man it can be a mess. | tensor([ 8.5475, -1.3489, -2.2465, -2.2552, -1.0791, -1.7647, -2.1237, -0.2507])
\n\nAnyway we'll keep going at least for meats and produce. | tensor([ 8.2831, -2.4533, -1.3931, -2.6227, -0.9431, -0.7919, -1.7741, -1.4051])
Just wanted to write a review based on my experience today.\n\nEverything I went for was in stock today (which doesn't always happen). | tensor([ 8.2428, -1.8065, -2.3618, -1.6740, -1.1820, -2.2074, -1.6586, -0.0705])
The place was crowded, as usual, but the line went fairly quickly. | tensor([ 7.7969, -2.3736, -2.3282, -2.2980, -0.2119, -0.6287, -1.1251, -1.5196])
On my way in, I saw a $5 fish sandwich with creamy coleslaw advertised outside. | tensor([ 0.5955, -3.2195,  1.2663, -2.2932, -1.9455,  7.6085, -0.8260, -1.5950])
Three guys were there cooking. | tensor([ 3.2157e+00, -1.6051e+00, -2.4119e+00, -2.0534e+00,  5.9730e+00,
        -1.4445e+00, -3.0530e+00, -4.7403e-03])
Looked and smelled delicious, so I paid inside with my groceries. | tensor([ 7.0248, -1.8629, -2.8464, -3.0259,  1.5517, -0.6504, -2.0312, -0.6889])
When I came out, I told the guys I bought one. | tensor([ 8.5399e+00, -1.7636e+00, -2.3022e+00, -2.6520e+00,  4.8805e-03,
        -2.2106e+00, -2.1919e+00, -1.4702e-01])
They were really nice and asked me what kind of bread I wanted and what I wanted on the sandwich.\n\nSome lady that was \"in a rush\" was upset her sandwich wasn't ready when she came out (but they explained the fish was cooked, but they couldn't set up the sandwich without knowing what bread or toppings she wanted). | tensor([ 0.9143,  1.7787, -3.0619, -1.0171,  6.6008, -0.7522, -2.0101, -1.6053])
Just watching the way they dealt with this customer was great for me. | tensor([ 8.7102, -1.6767, -2.4696, -2.6662, -0.1629, -2.1699, -1.7138, -0.5934])
The guys were so friendly and patient.\n\nAlso, the sandwich was delicious! | tensor([ 7.9751, -0.8554, -2.6505, -1.2683,  0.0804, -1.6338, -2.5251, -1.3493])
The coleslaw was also awesome! | tensor([ 1.1896, -3.5642,  0.7737, -3.0263, -1.4585,  8.1010, -1.5401, -1.0657])
I am so happy I stopped by when I did. | tensor([ 8.5168, -1.9175, -2.0738, -2.3366, -0.5832, -1.8311, -2.2527, -0.1051])
I love everything that Whole Foods offers, but I can't stand the experience of going there. | tensor([ 8.2519, -1.2336, -1.8972, -2.2960, -1.0692, -2.1424, -1.8792, -0.3547])
The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. | tensor([ 7.9849, -0.7713, -2.9101, -1.0896, -1.5816, -1.7766, -0.9965, -1.0535])
Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. | tensor([ 6.9348, -1.3783, -2.8863, -2.7374, -0.4041,  0.0659, -1.8686,  0.8517])
Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\n\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. | tensor([ 4.8604, -0.3517, -2.8683, -2.8487, -1.8358,  3.2123,  0.3635, -0.6856])
Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. | tensor([ 8.5347, -2.0959, -2.4106, -2.6319, -0.1379, -1.6070, -2.0107, -0.4759])
The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. | tensor([ 0.3492,  0.3123, -2.9478,  7.2424,  0.5835, -2.0333, -1.6152, -1.7462])
We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. | tensor([ 8.5239, -2.0973, -1.8861, -2.5401, -0.9274, -1.9350, -1.7223, -0.3238])
Pricey, but excellent quality. | tensor([ 8.4233, -2.0696, -2.3059, -2.8723, -0.0461, -1.2945, -2.0332, -0.6320])
The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good... | tensor([ 7.6436, -1.7882, -2.7233, -1.2281,  0.1665, -2.1085, -2.2473, -0.2580])
but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. | tensor([ 7.6434, -2.0970, -1.8165, -2.6102, -0.7300, -0.7189, -1.0371, -1.4090])
For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. | tensor([ 1.3092,  2.5570, -1.0689, -0.1669,  0.2404,  0.4695, -1.6546, -0.9348])
Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. | tensor([ 7.0893,  0.5998, -2.4331, -0.9255, -1.3177, -0.9577, -2.5347, -1.1181])
Their baked goods are delicious as well. | tensor([ 7.8701, -1.7334, -1.8362, -2.8150,  0.5825, -0.8849, -2.3504, -1.4070])
We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\n\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. | tensor([ 2.5082, -1.8547,  3.1038, -1.8816,  0.8343, -2.2230, -1.0728, -1.4274])
They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). | tensor([ 8.3803, -1.6151, -2.4575, -1.7723, -0.5549, -2.0515, -2.1722, -0.2470])
Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. | tensor([ 8.3621, -1.9655, -2.2620, -2.1569, -0.2107, -2.1663, -1.3952, -1.2462])
More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods. | tensor([ 7.0526, -2.5381,  0.0073, -1.4976, -2.1003, -0.7789, -1.1254, -1.5331])
Surprisingly, third-party & prepackaged pricing is actually on-par with Giant Eagle, so whenever we're looking for those types of items (milk/eggs/pastas, etc.), we always opt for Whole Foods. | tensor([ 8.2456, -1.7728, -2.2602, -2.3925, -0.4242, -1.6695, -1.6198, -0.9670])
when I think about shopping at Whole Foods, I always create an alternate universe where I think I would be able to shop here. | tensor([ 7.1518, -0.0175, -1.9416, -1.0743, -1.8317, -1.5556, -2.1861, -0.3483])
I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... | tensor([ 8.4499, -1.7672, -2.2780, -2.2464, -0.7994, -2.0053, -1.3623, -0.8638])
but I don't. | tensor([ 7.7196, -2.3326, -2.0590, -2.5135,  0.1725, -0.8712, -2.3170, -0.1358])
Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. | tensor([ 8.5726, -1.6756, -2.6875, -2.4181, -0.2602, -2.2002, -1.7315, -0.1383])
I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. | tensor([ 7.7049, -1.6429, -2.6754, -2.0065,  0.4709, -1.3588, -2.3552, -0.5564])
I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet. | tensor([ 8.1060, -2.8325, -1.1165, -1.2701, -1.3072, -1.6181, -1.1208, -1.7863])
The quality of everything is pretty incredible (though of course it's typically really expensive). | tensor([ 8.1546, -1.4254, -1.9708, -2.1028, -1.1321, -1.1291, -2.3788, -0.3079])
I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. | tensor([ 8.4719, -1.8959, -2.0281, -2.3012, -0.7322, -1.7135, -1.9654, -0.6122])
I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. | tensor([ 8.1820, -1.0381, -1.9651, -1.8824, -1.5411, -1.7895, -2.2602,  0.1275])
It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. | tensor([ 8.5005, -1.1424, -2.7747, -2.5389, -0.1993, -1.9805, -1.4593, -1.0084])
I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. | tensor([ 8.6110, -2.1524, -2.3052, -1.8240, -0.5418, -2.2264, -1.4408, -0.9205])
Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. | tensor([ 8.3446, -1.8277, -2.2711, -2.4325, -0.9968, -0.9173, -1.9405, -0.7879])
\n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. | tensor([ 7.9826, -2.3058, -1.9348, -2.2000, -0.8844, -1.2020, -0.5641, -1.5893])
They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. | tensor([-1.8679, -0.6924,  3.0042,  0.9318, -1.7816,  0.2731,  0.4222, -0.1433])
They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. | tensor([ 8.0042, -1.5773, -1.5111, -2.5949, -0.7398, -0.7725, -1.9495, -1.3106])
\n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. | tensor([ 7.2245, -1.1348, -3.0288, -1.5321,  0.4875, -1.1221, -2.4911, -0.6780])
Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. | tensor([ 3.7133, -0.7369, -2.4792, -2.7643,  3.5114, -1.0070, -3.6022,  2.3492])
My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. | tensor([ 2.9605, -1.5455,  0.0693, -0.4437, -0.1693, -0.0361, -0.3593, -1.4436])
I adore this bread. | tensor([ 6.8028, -2.4111,  1.7070, -2.5295, -1.3137, -1.0126, -2.2319, -1.7213])
It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. | tensor([ 6.8935, -1.5865, -2.1022, -1.4946,  0.2314,  0.1949, -2.6646, -1.1460])
Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. | tensor([ 3.1983, -0.2110, -2.9473,  1.6608,  2.5585, -0.9899, -2.8289, -1.4972])
If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. | tensor([-0.3843,  5.7695, -2.1382,  3.5244, -0.1885, -1.8271, -2.2997, -0.5197])
chicken salad. | tensor([ 7.3164, -3.1087, -2.2675, -2.3855,  1.4711, -0.2515, -1.5512, -1.7669])
Yum yum yum! | tensor([ 8.2392, -2.1051, -2.4646, -2.9590,  0.9638, -1.4586, -2.1914, -0.7774])
\n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. | tensor([ 8.0689, -2.0094, -1.7107, -2.6663, -0.8704, -0.2689, -2.2406, -0.6508])
I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. | tensor([ 7.6286, -1.5471, -2.1767, -1.5262, -0.1315, -1.8981, -1.7559, -0.8054])
This soup delivers. | tensor([ 8.5414, -2.2137, -2.2859, -2.5061,  0.0305, -2.2884, -1.5975, -0.6737])
I wish I could have it every single day. | tensor([ 8.5111, -1.9036, -2.2730, -2.7909, -0.2460, -1.7346, -2.3537,  0.1359])
It's so phenomenal! | tensor([ 8.1943, -1.8402, -2.2776, -2.1127,  0.1156, -1.6027, -2.4312, -0.6662])
My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. | tensor([ 4.0096, -1.9760, -2.8707, -1.7365,  1.3861,  3.1326, -2.5212, -0.7125])
\n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. | tensor([ 5.3005, -0.7408, -2.8652,  0.0505,  1.5092, -1.1354, -0.8821, -2.5258])
We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. | tensor([ 8.0609, -2.0051, -2.0465, -2.0941, -1.0081, -0.9140, -1.9946, -0.8318])
We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! | tensor([ 7.5040, -0.4628, -0.8774, -2.9168, -0.5162, -1.4567, -1.7761, -1.7346])
The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. | tensor([ 5.8675,  0.1108, -2.2438, -1.5652,  1.4523, -2.1105, -2.5152, -0.8756])
You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. | tensor([ 7.6689, -1.8110, -2.0605, -0.4172, -0.6716, -2.4547, -1.9930, -0.9109])
The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore | tensor([ 8.6192, -2.0197, -2.1067, -2.4035, -0.2616, -2.1763, -1.7220, -0.9367])
Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. | tensor([ 8.5635, -1.7123, -2.2544, -2.6476, -0.5495, -2.1266, -1.8785, -0.0329])
Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. | tensor([ 8.1532, -1.6073, -2.0211, -2.9751, -1.2098, -0.9773, -1.9087, -0.0656])
They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole | tensor([ 8.2094, -1.6783, -2.1169, -2.2741, -0.3602, -1.2071, -2.3840, -1.0073])
Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! | tensor([ 5.8653,  0.9100, -2.7044,  0.5560, -0.6186, -2.5816, -1.3946, -1.2361])
I primarily shop here for special items though. | tensor([ 6.0276, -2.1353, -2.6673,  3.0270, -0.4565, -1.8792, -2.7192, -0.7617])
\n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. | tensor([ 7.9052, -1.9174, -1.9966, -2.9439, -0.3921, -0.4641, -1.9963, -0.7788])
If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here! | tensor([ 1.4852, -0.6935, -2.6263,  7.0732, -0.1362, -1.8839, -2.5655, -1.1702])
My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. | tensor([ 8.4543, -1.9461, -2.4429, -2.6489, -0.0835, -1.8029, -1.9514, -0.3643])
Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. | tensor([ 7.9708, -1.7868, -2.3315, -2.6762,  0.4189, -1.0241, -1.8816, -1.5424])
On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. | tensor([ 7.0916, -0.0382, -2.3535, -2.4561, -1.4921, -1.7646, -2.1474,  1.4352])
However, the parking is horrendous! | tensor([ 8.5663, -2.1815, -2.3332, -2.2987, -0.1467, -1.7791, -1.7471, -0.8370])
Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? | tensor([ 7.1992, -0.5684, -2.0590, -1.1316, -1.5685, -2.4497, -1.8868,  0.3378])
Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. | tensor([ 8.2642, -2.1257, -2.4023, -2.2714, -0.9256, -1.7979, -0.9503, -0.3241])
I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.\n\nParking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. | tensor([ 8.5760, -1.8422, -2.3870, -2.4834, -0.7089, -1.9361, -1.7828, -0.0727])
You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). | tensor([ 7.1923, -0.3395, -2.5145, -0.8198, -1.0757, -2.1562, -1.8975, -0.6026])
Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet. | tensor([ 8.5616, -1.7224, -2.4065, -2.5862, -0.4084, -1.8358, -1.8972, -0.5171])
I will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and I must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that I mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it. | tensor([ 8.4831, -2.5662, -2.3040, -2.2952, -0.3521, -2.2367, -0.7214, -0.9598])
I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. | tensor([ 8.5031, -1.0925, -2.5762, -1.8895, -0.6963, -2.3509, -1.9680, -0.5226])
I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. | tensor([ 8.6445, -2.1443, -2.0767, -2.4434, -0.6650, -2.0799, -1.6804, -0.4952])
I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. | tensor([ 5.8461, -1.6638, -0.6936, -1.6632, -1.4760,  0.2491, -3.7272,  1.7058])
I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. | tensor([ 5.1756, -0.3950, -0.6347, -0.2323, -2.2263,  0.1555, -1.9926, -0.4494])
But I must repeat myself about the price. | tensor([ 8.5424, -2.1417, -2.0684, -2.5540, -0.2986, -1.8986, -1.7767, -0.7401])
For what I got it's way to much. | tensor([ 8.5253, -1.8562, -2.4351, -2.6205, -0.2130, -1.8042, -2.0484, -0.3550])
It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home. | tensor([ 8.3416, -1.1797, -2.3526, -2.7353, -0.9532, -1.9934, -2.3228,  0.5421])
Now I know I don't have to cook or clean | tensor([ 8.5978, -1.8894, -2.2262, -2.8908, -0.2857, -1.9199, -2.1023, -0.0616])
and that's the point of eating out | tensor([ 8.3257, -1.5699, -1.9492, -1.8872, -1.0242, -1.7914, -1.8736, -1.0691])
but I could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods. | tensor([ 8.3362, -2.0257, -0.9461, -2.5603, -0.8787, -1.6798, -2.4098, -0.6049])
Yes, the parking lot in crazy. | tensor([ 6.0642, -1.0637, -3.3604, -3.1548,  0.3923, -0.5344, -1.8454,  2.2288])
Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). | tensor([ 8.2007, -1.8244, -2.4030, -2.6331, -0.4992, -1.7305, -1.1462, -0.8770])
Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. | tensor([ 8.0139, -2.1775, -1.5914, -0.4461, -1.9194, -1.6077, -1.1444, -1.5210])
All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. | tensor([ 8.4639, -2.0720, -2.2729, -2.6194, -0.0496, -1.7308, -1.9350, -0.7470])
Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. | tensor([ 8.6845, -2.2182, -2.1847, -2.3897, -0.2862, -2.0235, -1.3961, -1.0697])
For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! | tensor([ 1.4586, -0.3003, -3.2193, -2.4968,  1.3926,  0.9971, -0.3461,  2.3609])
I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. | tensor([ 8.5753, -1.9281, -2.2357, -2.2017, -0.7519, -2.3039, -1.6607, -0.1634])
Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. | tensor([ 2.5129,  0.0373,  0.0356,  2.7863, -4.1011, -2.6248, -1.0752,  1.0694])
Stop being lazy. | tensor([ 8.5515, -1.8370, -2.2629, -2.2197, -0.7168, -1.9437, -1.2355, -1.2466])
(Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). | tensor([ 8.6074, -2.1448, -2.3611, -2.3398, -0.1126, -2.2373, -1.5131, -0.8416])
\n\nThe produce is fantastic, always. | tensor([ 7.6879, -1.5108, -2.2566, -2.6957, -0.7004, -0.4396, -1.4216, -0.8769])
And not just the organic stuff either. | tensor([ 8.0191, -2.1346, -1.7316, -2.0516, -0.3503, -1.6832, -1.2784, -1.5481])
The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. | tensor([ 7.3443, -1.6719, -0.9863, -2.6994, -2.4437, -0.4844, -1.3930,  0.0424])
The quality of the meat department is second to none. | tensor([ 8.6100, -2.0111, -2.4324, -3.0461, -0.2218, -1.5634, -1.4532, -0.6089])
Now, the bakery is a little ' | tensor([ 8.4756, -1.4438, -2.2652, -2.8377, -0.2768, -2.2202, -1.9874, -0.0715])
Eh' for me. | tensor([ 8.0933, -2.2351, -2.4246, -2.9641,  1.2908, -1.3319, -2.1885, -1.0317])
The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. | tensor([ 3.7870, -1.4682, -2.6038, -2.3811,  5.3960,  0.5949, -1.6835, -2.0682])
Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. | tensor([ 8.3612, -2.0588, -2.0445, -2.1748, -0.6770, -0.9887, -1.7022, -1.2014])
It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is... | tensor([ 8.5943, -1.9863, -2.3304, -2.1344, -0.2060, -2.2609, -1.8806, -0.4713])
\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. | tensor([ 7.1798, -2.6833, -1.8805, -1.6961, -0.5009, -0.2145, -0.8323, -1.6752])
The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. | tensor([ 8.4610, -2.5469, -2.1096, -1.9534, -0.4189, -2.3752, -1.0535, -0.9680])

My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. | tensor([ 1.5737, -1.1133, -2.9785, -3.0101,  7.1313,  0.0510, -2.3692,  1.2477])

\n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\" that has the BEST real chicken texture. | tensor([ 4.6707, -2.6526, -1.1625, -1.4492, -2.2626, -1.4285,  3.9492, -2.2507])
It's really good! | tensor([ 8.2375, -1.9348, -2.1403, -2.2922, -0.1906, -1.6204, -2.5526, -0.0283])
The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. | tensor([ 4.9103, -3.3478,  2.6873, -3.0611, -1.2969,  0.5998, -2.3552, -1.0488])
Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. | tensor([ 8.3656, -1.8412, -2.5806, -1.2511, -0.1951, -2.2432, -2.0499, -0.7988])
\n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. | tensor([ 8.0881, -1.2424, -2.3741, -3.4410, -0.1877, -0.3569, -1.2172, -1.6835])

In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. | tensor([ 7.9474, -1.3767, -2.6499, -1.7611, -0.5475, -2.3196, -2.1717,  0.5869])
It's next to sushi. | tensor([ 6.9379, -0.7876, -2.0418, -2.7787,  1.0262, -1.4300, -3.4735,  0.6482])
It's very good | tensor([ 8.4951, -2.1298, -2.1188, -2.2879, -0.2755, -1.6481, -2.2613, -0.5381])
As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. | tensor([ 8.0669, -1.7285, -1.9795, -1.6383, -1.1874, -2.3747, -1.5953, -0.6805])
It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. | tensor([ 6.7330, -1.8610, -1.6637, -2.9573, -1.8729,  3.0900, -2.1207, -0.7824])
My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. | tensor([ 7.8915, -1.6252, -2.0207, -2.4112, -0.7090, -1.4476, -0.8277, -1.5146])
Not this \"conventional\" garbage. | tensor([ 8.3933, -2.4445, -2.0757, -2.8378, -0.3327, -1.5159, -1.3551, -0.9218])
Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. | tensor([ 8.4935, -2.0435, -1.8151, -2.2157, -0.8359, -1.4072, -2.0115, -0.8336])

Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. | tensor([ 8.3429, -1.7434, -1.6173, -1.2960, -1.3988, -2.4399, -2.1124, -0.4000])
There was honking, some road rage and confusion. | tensor([ 8.5323, -2.3623, -2.2124, -1.8660, -0.6991, -1.8081, -1.6187, -0.9275])
But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday. | tensor([ 8.5064, -1.9079, -2.5548, -2.3443,  0.2681, -2.5154, -1.9120, -0.3691])

The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.   | tensor([ 4.3403, -1.3412, -2.4530,  1.5302,  2.1092, -2.2565, -3.3417,  0.2386])

The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.   | tensor([ 8.5040, -2.1988, -2.0417, -2.0765, -0.5481, -1.9969, -1.9493, -0.5598])

Sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant Mediterranean.\n\nThis was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone. | tensor([-0.6110, -2.8314,  7.6473, -2.8054, -2.0965,  0.7538, -1.8354,  0.3649])

The food was good, and I had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.\n\nThat said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food. | tensor([ 8.5496, -2.3064, -2.2924, -2.4634, -0.2554, -2.0721, -1.3246, -0.9750])

There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. | tensor([ 6.9117, -1.7989, -2.7702, -2.2099,  2.1231, -0.9682, -2.4951, -1.1272])

The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. | tensor([ 7.3206, -1.4574, -2.9542, -3.0641,  1.0473, -0.7597, -1.8720, -0.9671])

The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \n\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. | tensor([ 8.3352, -2.0651, -2.1972, -1.9755, -0.8220, -1.7604, -1.2934, -1.1222])

One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.\n\nFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. | tensor([ 6.3909, -1.1869, -1.9137, -2.7827, -1.2668, -1.4540, -2.9056,  3.1099])

Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. | tensor([ 7.9681, -1.4898, -2.7158, -0.8492, -1.2387, -2.2540, -0.9734, -1.0241])

Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \"the host is supposed to do that | tensor([ 7.1843, -1.4469, -3.2606, -1.9958,  2.2625, -2.3067, -0.7118, -1.7457])

The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. | tensor([-0.6311,  0.9612,  1.6446, -0.3574, -0.7980,  0.7308, -0.8717, -0.5304])
I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. | tensor([ 2.4020,  0.1646, -1.2281,  6.0499, -1.8529, -1.6326, -1.5597, -2.0660])
The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. | tensor([ 8.1797, -1.1769, -2.4432, -2.8445, -0.2576, -1.4759, -2.5280, -0.1056])
\nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. | tensor([ 7.4912, -0.4607, -2.6937, -2.7250,  0.2858, -1.1290, -2.1390, -0.6760])
This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. | tensor([ 7.8854, -1.4448, -2.3577, -1.9991, -0.1737, -1.1092, -2.4396, -0.7000])
It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. | tensor([ 8.0153, -0.9288, -2.6335, -3.1904,  0.2250, -1.7963, -2.5512,  0.4429])
He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. | tensor([ 8.3249, -1.9779, -2.3801, -2.9083,  0.4431, -1.2421, -2.3237, -0.5840])
I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. | tensor([ 7.5951, -0.3179, -2.2426, -2.6401, -1.4296, -2.1268, -2.4278,  1.2641])
It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. | tensor([ 8.0879, -1.3445, -2.4643, -2.5752, -0.7642, -1.0219, -2.4270, -0.1408])
\nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. | tensor([ 8.4339, -2.4455, -2.5900, -2.3686,  0.5566, -2.1984, -1.5718, -0.8612])
I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. | tensor([ 7.9708, -1.6176, -2.4490, -2.0734, -1.1683, -1.9540, -2.2451,  0.8113])
While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. | tensor([ 8.5667, -1.9103, -1.8356, -2.4608, -1.0928, -1.5557, -1.5676, -1.0188])
And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna! | tensor([ 8.2021, -0.9881, -2.4211, -2.6274, -0.6476, -1.7914, -2.0766, -0.3894])
For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel. | tensor([ 8.2256, -1.6669, -2.0151, -2.8199, -1.5033, -1.8448, -2.1340,  1.2275])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option... | tensor([ 8.5040, -2.3304, -1.4988, -2.2787, -0.7793, -2.0403, -2.1521, -0.4216])
well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered. | tensor([ 1.8414,  1.0079, -3.2263, -1.6849,  6.5199, -1.7599, -1.5352,  0.0115])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed. | tensor([ 8.7063, -1.8567, -2.2789, -2.8432, -0.4032, -1.9187, -1.6156, -0.6468])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven. | tensor([ 8.2453, -1.0048, -2.7873, -2.0268, -0.3535, -2.6384, -1.4725, -0.6093])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes... | tensor([ 8.7457, -1.9369, -2.1616, -2.4687, -0.4245, -2.1945, -1.6244, -0.7825])
well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar... | tensor([ 7.3678, -2.4569, -3.0588, -1.9458,  2.1733, -1.6020, -1.2710, -1.8010])
I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"   | tensor([ 5.9582,  1.3154, -3.2052, -2.8047,  1.7544, -2.8396, -2.2081,  1.4372])
While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"   | tensor([ 8.2501, -1.6369, -2.8244, -2.6884,  0.6572, -2.3838, -1.8846,  0.1150])
Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. | tensor([ 8.1177, -1.8501, -2.5718, -2.9661,  0.2419, -1.3011, -1.8864, -0.4394])
While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive. | tensor([ 6.5599, -0.7223, -2.9017, -0.8669,  1.6631, -1.7167, -3.4797, -0.2969])
 Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts. | tensor([ 2.8398,  1.1184, -2.6909,  3.9105,  0.0045, -1.5968, -2.5716, -1.0459])
 Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly. | tensor([ 8.4178, -1.5075, -2.6730, -1.8947, -0.2656, -2.1169, -2.0286, -0.5371])
 Moving on to the pasta | tensor([ 1.9304, -1.6718, -2.6994, -2.5228,  8.0316, -1.1423, -2.4165, -0.2879])
- we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes. | tensor([ 8.2872, -1.9646, -2.1845, -1.6846, -0.9140, -1.7294, -1.5574, -0.8918])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette. | tensor([ 8.2740, -1.4160, -2.6956, -2.5257,  0.5946, -2.1114, -2.0182, -0.5278])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs. | tensor([ 5.6619, -1.7949, -1.5650, -1.1270, -0.5158, -1.9461, -2.4537,  1.7827])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time. | tensor([ 7.9786, -2.3280, -1.9751, -2.5691, -0.5625, -1.1703, -1.9197, -0.4084])

With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years. | tensor([ 8.0297, -0.7664, -3.1197, -1.7603,  0.5601, -3.1196, -2.1640,  0.1232])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.   | tensor([ 8.6570, -2.2236, -2.3171, -2.4596, -0.0181, -2.2738, -1.3819, -0.8600])
He closed with \"I hope you will join us again.\" I will not. | tensor([ 7.6939, -2.9005, -1.5609, -1.8107, -0.4900, -1.5356, -0.9508, -1.1596])
great atmosphere and great food. | tensor([ 8.2926, -2.3669, -1.9103, -2.2177, -0.3438, -1.1938, -2.1459, -1.0505])
while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\n\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy. | tensor([ 8.1113, -2.2392, -1.7314, -2.0591, -1.3322, -1.0091, -2.0734, -0.4741])
I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.   | tensor([ 8.6428, -2.3745, -2.0610, -2.2342, -0.6834, -2.2160, -1.2996, -0.8072])
Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer. | tensor([ 7.8981, -1.9740, -1.7305, -1.9967, -0.2436, -1.8724, -2.0742, -0.5210])

It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\n\nI came back for dinner a month or so later. | tensor([ 8.2322, -1.5970, -2.3635, -1.7076, -0.7473, -1.3687, -1.9720, -1.0796])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy. | tensor([ 7.7751, -1.9278, -2.8116, -2.3570,  1.7156, -2.0128, -2.2281, -0.8359])

We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.   | tensor([-0.4056, -1.1501,  5.1361, -2.1102, -2.1464,  0.3953, -0.8775,  0.2686])
And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant. | tensor([ 3.6390, -1.5984, -1.8992, -1.1055,  2.3737, -0.6917, -2.8898,  0.8337])

Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu. | tensor([ 7.2226,  0.6070, -2.5060, -2.3773, -0.7370, -2.2558, -2.4270,  0.7974])

But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat. | tensor([ 8.1714, -1.9166, -2.0891, -2.0051, -0.9138, -1.3472, -2.6990,  0.1545])

A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal. | tensor([ 6.0430, -1.4884, -2.7899,  0.1469,  0.5985, -1.6858, -0.6756, -2.0686])
 Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\n\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees. | tensor([ 6.7894, -0.5667, -2.9009, -1.1825, -1.5855, -1.0896,  0.2299, -1.3344])

I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth. | tensor([ 8.0119, -2.5439, -2.2076, -2.2889, -0.1414, -1.4389, -1.7916, -0.4127])

There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass. | tensor([ 5.7917, -2.2758, -0.8482, -1.8532, -1.5913,  1.0483, -0.8995, -1.3251])

It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love. | tensor([ 8.4427, -1.8328, -2.2373, -2.2172, -0.5535, -1.9182, -2.4929,  0.3242])

Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy. | tensor([ 8.5081, -2.4819, -1.9910, -2.6720, -0.7038, -1.7905, -0.8247, -1.1737])

When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass. | tensor([ 0.0419,  1.4097, -1.2646, -2.5098, -1.4958, -1.8997, -0.9256,  6.8488])

We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress? | tensor([ 6.3135, -2.1615, -0.0785, -0.1361, -2.8041, -0.9984, -1.6943, -0.3804])

It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\n\nThings got better during the actual dinner. | tensor([ 8.0010, -2.0178, -2.1955, -0.9438, -1.4194, -2.0519, -1.9145, -0.1672])

I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta. | tensor([ 4.9587, -3.0833, -1.9863, -2.8937, -0.6100,  3.0381, -0.8074, -0.3281])

Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.   | tensor([ 3.7043,  3.2117, -2.8868, -0.9182,  0.9587, -1.2993, -3.0844,  0.8924])

The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.   | tensor([ 7.9570, -1.9806, -1.9924, -2.3364, -0.4727, -1.2058, -2.3105, -0.5761])
Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.   | tensor([ 4.0082, -1.4835, -1.0963, -3.6390, -1.1962,  5.7322, -1.1199, -1.7839])
I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.   | tensor([ 8.3675, -1.8948, -2.2533, -2.3903, -0.4495, -1.5864, -2.3216, -0.3290])
Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.   | tensor([-0.1616,  0.6003, -1.1322, -2.3938,  0.4687,  6.8982, -1.3207, -1.7085])
Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\n\nWe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them. | tensor([ 4.3531, -1.6558, -1.9741, -0.7471,  1.8203,  1.2777, -2.5798, -1.2324])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.   | tensor([ 8.6295, -1.9615, -2.1817, -2.4829, -0.5733, -2.0805, -1.7642, -0.4413])
I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.   | tensor([ 6.8044,  0.6583, -3.6478, -1.8614,  1.5457, -2.3020, -2.9808, -0.2430])
\n\nOverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating. | tensor([ 1.9789, -2.1118, -2.9157, -2.4078,  8.1386, -1.4845, -1.3425, -0.5474])

I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.   | tensor([ 6.0845, -1.7409,  0.8958, -1.5587, -2.2686, -0.6637, -1.4641, -1.8450])
But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner. | tensor([ 8.6270, -2.2411, -2.2054, -2.2226, -0.4380, -2.3328, -1.5154, -0.6176])

I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal. | tensor([ 5.1970, -0.3271, -2.8873,  2.6617, -1.0197, -2.1805, -3.0740, -0.1685])
Very tasty food and drinks! | tensor([ 8.1784, -2.0064, -1.9236, -1.9562, -0.0588, -1.7176, -2.4864, -0.9551])
Its a little pricey, but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain. | tensor([ 8.4551, -1.9589, -2.3494, -2.5600, -0.2075, -1.7618, -1.9893, -0.5414])
The interior is very nice. | tensor([ 8.5009, -2.2562, -2.0557, -2.5357, -0.4016, -1.2914, -2.1683, -0.6048])
The food is a hit or miss. | tensor([ 7.9695, -2.4135, -2.1169, -2.8334, -0.2652, -2.0117, -1.9693,  0.7902])
We went for brunch today. | tensor([ 8.4953, -2.2390, -2.1183, -2.4240, -0.7709, -1.5011, -2.0322, -0.3974])
You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. | tensor([ 7.5701, -2.2170, -2.3562, -1.2399,  0.1691, -1.8682, -2.0537, -0.4690])
The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. | tensor([ 7.8717, -1.6560, -2.8873, -2.2868,  0.2616, -1.6471, -2.2327, -0.1745])
The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. | tensor([ 8.0324, -2.6915, -1.7449, -2.0991, -0.0966, -1.5445, -1.5909, -1.6189])
We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. | tensor([ 6.7349, -1.1074, -2.2957, -2.1476,  0.3242,  0.2792, -2.0330, -1.0848])
The omelet was very bland. | tensor([ 8.3821, -2.0573, -2.2447, -2.4782,  0.0356, -1.7211, -1.8251, -0.8606])
It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. | tensor([ 7.2637, -0.5453, -2.2730, -2.1177,  0.0757, -0.6573, -2.5014, -0.7082])
Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. | tensor([ 7.5805, -0.8430, -2.5476, -2.7985, -0.6195, -2.1978, -2.8187,  1.7572])
My drink mimosa was just OK. | tensor([ 8.4763, -1.8987, -2.5926, -2.5874,  0.3183, -1.7485, -2.3751, -0.2974])
My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. | tensor([ 8.2264, -1.8381, -2.7145, -2.8485,  0.6658, -1.9763, -2.1155, -0.1662])
\n\nI have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. | tensor([ 4.2905, -1.9307,  4.0140, -2.4226, -3.1007, -1.0173, -3.2630,  1.6882])
The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. | tensor([ 8.5773, -2.3255, -2.1784, -2.1522, -0.5220, -1.8331, -1.7920, -0.5384])
It gradually went down to 3 stars. | tensor([ 8.6013, -2.0636, -2.2012, -2.1712, -0.2580, -2.4465, -1.7211, -0.4367])
The wine selection is good. | tensor([ 8.6007, -2.3734, -2.1048, -2.5116, -0.2237, -1.8416, -1.7475, -0.7687])
But the food is definitely hit or miss. | tensor([ 8.5433, -2.4891, -1.7521, -2.6941, -0.6562, -1.8276, -1.7291, -0.4258])
Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. | tensor([ 2.5350, -2.6523,  4.8735, -3.1793, -2.2578,  0.1709, -2.6854,  1.1547])
It was not well cooked or fresh, or something. | tensor([ 8.5332, -2.1423, -1.6879, -2.3072, -0.5328, -1.3731, -2.4547, -0.5130])
Consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; Casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard. | tensor([ 8.5202, -2.0284, -2.3040, -2.0250, -0.2814, -2.3618, -2.1310, -0.3289])
\n\nMy bf | tensor([ 8.2902, -2.1656, -2.3750, -2.7385,  0.1975, -1.2661, -1.7302, -0.9932])
and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. | tensor([ 6.7657, -1.8070, -3.0014, -2.0328,  2.0785, -1.2533, -2.3301, -0.6162])
The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. | tensor([ 3.0914, -2.0712, -2.3699, -2.4799,  7.1353, -1.0399, -2.2405, -1.1804])
We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). | tensor([ 4.0147, -0.8476, -3.2628,  1.9638,  1.6502, -3.2355, -1.9791,  0.2996])
She did not offer suggestions or advice.\n\nWe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. | tensor([ 0.5502,  0.0329, -2.5712, -1.6932,  6.6580, -0.3401, -2.1149, -0.0078])
The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. | tensor([ 8.1479, -1.5376, -2.6047, -2.6774,  0.6993, -1.5293, -2.4973, -0.6791])
The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\n\nThe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. | tensor([ 1.0683, -1.7432, -2.3676, -1.7723,  6.9129,  0.3361, -2.5617, -0.2929])
After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. | tensor([ 8.2927, -1.9932, -2.4695, -2.9373,  0.7822, -2.3348, -1.3576, -0.7498])
I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it. | tensor([ 8.7373, -2.1646, -2.3247, -2.6464,  0.2647, -2.1319, -1.7280, -0.8965])
I have to agree with the \"hit or miss\" reviewers about Casbah, at least when it comes to the food. | tensor([ 8.3967, -1.8106, -2.5100, -1.8436, -0.4611, -2.6028, -1.9850, -0.0584])
I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. | tensor([ 8.0157, -2.6325, -0.9951, -2.7082, -1.9820, -1.6760, -0.5505, -0.3724])
They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. | tensor([ 2.2245, -3.6937,  0.8679, -3.3523, -0.4846,  5.7249, -1.3264, -1.0278])
And our waiter, Daniel, was great. | tensor([ 7.0008, -2.7357, -2.5162, -2.2676,  2.4604, -1.4365, -2.7835, -0.2433])
\n\nThe previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. | tensor([ 8.4543, -2.1683, -2.2715, -1.8105, -0.6728, -2.6068, -1.6461, -0.1445])
It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. | tensor([ 8.5045, -2.1181, -1.9903, -1.7418, -0.8165, -1.7434, -2.0523, -0.6492])
The mimosa and sangria were very \"eh.\" \n\nI loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. | tensor([ 6.5554, -2.9530, -2.9761,  1.0005,  0.2212, -1.6046, -1.4728, -0.6261])
The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. | tensor([ 8.6122, -1.8104, -2.5029, -2.4101, -0.1812, -2.1032, -1.7113, -0.7091])
The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. | tensor([ 0.5120, -2.2014,  1.7773, -1.4405, -3.3120,  7.0440, -0.8719, -1.6294])
\n\nIf I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot. | tensor([ 8.1199, -1.4677, -2.1031, -2.3938, -1.4787, -1.0369, -2.6358,  0.4996])
I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.   | tensor([ 8.2417, -1.3691, -2.0781, -2.3970, -0.4681, -1.8605, -2.6314,  0.0224])
Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. | tensor([ 7.8211, -2.1532, -0.4989, -2.1340, -2.4998, -1.3337, -1.4097, -0.5230])
\n\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice | tensor([ 3.7029,  0.1311, -3.5563, -1.9861,  5.2307, -1.1125, -2.4350,  0.1991])
actually.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food. | tensor([ 5.9332, -2.2878,  0.1839, -1.5707, -2.2581,  0.4851, -1.0827, -2.0179])

If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds. | tensor([ 7.8440, -1.1568, -1.7044, -1.6283, -1.1891, -2.2891, -2.4615, -0.1132])
My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening. | tensor([ 7.1991, -1.6758, -1.5519, -3.5124, -0.1090, -1.0635, -3.0507,  1.5706])

We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night. | tensor([ 5.5984,  1.1468, -3.0056, -2.8785,  0.6526, -3.7794, -2.1392,  3.3495])

So much for romantic! | tensor([ 8.5239, -2.1109, -2.3351, -2.4894,  0.3908, -2.1074, -1.7583, -0.9085])

Ever hear of a babysitter? | tensor([ 7.9444, -1.0296, -2.3846, -2.5461, -0.3622, -2.1001, -2.4553,  0.6396])

Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+. | tensor([ 8.5834, -2.2855, -2.1244, -1.8734, -0.3595, -1.8694, -1.4158, -1.5402])

We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal. | tensor([ 5.3956, -0.6800, -2.2860, -2.0099,  2.4232, -0.6006, -3.3709, -0.1032])

The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.   | tensor([ 7.9346, -1.7517, -2.2321, -1.8802, -0.4161, -1.0558, -1.7441, -1.1648])
We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless. | tensor([ 8.5080, -2.1672, -2.2702, -2.3250, -0.4893, -1.9282, -1.7789, -0.4440])

I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. | tensor([ 8.2758, -1.7401, -2.3865, -2.6995, -0.2602, -1.9300, -1.8241, -0.0991])
These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December. | tensor([ 7.4127, -1.6957, -1.4859, -2.8347, -0.4685, -1.3294, -2.2308,  0.5191])
 Very disappointing. | tensor([ 8.6245, -2.3546, -2.1555, -2.6164, -0.0749, -2.0112, -1.2286, -1.2108])

I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu. | tensor([ 8.4107, -2.4097, -1.8999, -2.2859, -0.3035, -1.5492, -2.0658, -0.8269])

It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.   | tensor([ 8.3919, -2.1726, -2.1022, -2.4266, -0.7199, -1.3803, -1.7232, -0.5109])

My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food. | tensor([ 8.4467, -2.1520, -1.8241, -2.4586, -0.9118, -1.5219, -1.8271, -0.7279])

All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine. | tensor([ 8.4768, -2.7438, -1.9430, -1.5947, -0.7830, -1.9242, -1.5622, -1.2096])

I might return here for happy hour | tensor([ 8.6382, -1.9700, -2.0054, -2.5056, -0.4197, -1.6100, -2.0250, -0.8331])
but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner. | tensor([ 7.4747, -1.8343, -2.4600, -0.5272, -0.2078, -2.2450, -2.9480,  0.2364])

And we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home. | tensor([ 8.0149, -1.4494, -2.1613, -2.8985, -0.7450, -2.0206, -2.1649,  0.5045])
I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. | tensor([ 8.3539, -1.6665, -2.3400, -2.8228, -0.2770, -1.8497, -2.5722,  0.4363])
Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. | tensor([ 8.6271, -2.1722, -2.1442, -2.0593, -0.6910, -2.1857, -1.9505, -0.2191])
Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. | tensor([ 3.1389, -1.4403, -2.6131, -3.4575,  3.8295,  1.5940, -2.6392,  0.8249])
We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. | tensor([ 8.4785, -1.6549, -2.3175, -2.9664, -0.8949, -0.8599, -2.2660, -0.2203])
Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. | tensor([ 1.3458, -1.7878, -1.8321, -0.0442,  5.4921, -0.5947, -2.2972, -1.2030])
I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. | tensor([ 8.1400, -2.5113, -1.5759, -1.3857, -0.7390, -1.6518, -1.7005, -1.3012])
It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. | tensor([ 8.5929, -2.3207, -1.8907, -1.9721, -0.9227, -2.2628, -1.5388, -0.6961])
I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. | tensor([ 8.2744, -1.4450, -1.9650, -2.4968, -0.7816, -1.5983, -1.7707, -1.0784])
I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). | tensor([ 7.9961, -1.9705, -1.9675, -2.0197, -0.2031, -1.8699, -2.2851, -0.5913])
The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. | tensor([ 3.5979, -0.8992, -2.8534, -1.4883,  4.6182, -0.3566, -2.5005, -1.2434])
After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. | tensor([ 8.4609, -1.4468, -2.4390, -2.0698, -0.4574, -2.2186, -2.1587, -0.3657])
I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. | tensor([ 8.0972, -1.7720, -2.1615, -2.5301,  0.0451, -1.5500, -2.1873, -0.5324])
Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome | tensor([ 8.4299, -1.3069, -2.8201, -2.3645, -0.1736, -1.9333, -1.8047, -0.7902])
but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it. | tensor([ 8.5653, -2.2304, -2.0337, -2.9978, -0.4745, -1.7195, -1.6869, -0.4508])
Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here. | tensor([ 7.7011, -2.4439, -1.5742, -1.4392, -1.6293,  0.0701, -2.2916, -0.4996])

Having finally come for lunch, I overall enjoyed it | tensor([ 8.6046, -1.7545, -1.9995, -2.0969, -1.1050, -2.1606, -2.1000, -0.1654])
but it had some ups and some downs. | tensor([ 8.4425, -1.9097, -2.1832, -2.3721, -0.6104, -1.2875, -2.1612, -0.6142])

\n\nI ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.   | tensor([ 5.6435, -1.8111, -1.2798, -0.0347, -0.2792, -0.1633, -2.6233, -0.7294])
It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich. | tensor([ 1.7479,  0.2864, -2.6702, -0.1183,  5.0994, -1.3723, -2.3041, -1.1055])

For me, the size was just right. | tensor([ 7.6731,  0.0815, -2.2914, -3.1975, -0.5212, -1.0174, -2.9544,  0.3465])

The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.   | tensor([ 8.3461, -1.4235, -2.4021, -2.4220, -0.4766, -1.9052, -2.5813,  0.2287])
The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice. | tensor([-0.1649,  1.3134, -3.2413, -0.1481,  6.1591, -0.2467, -1.6274, -0.9214])

I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though. | tensor([ 7.8262, -1.0953, -2.4610, -2.5679,  0.0257, -1.7043, -2.9490,  0.6926])

The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream. | tensor([ 7.7943, -1.8300, -2.9814, -2.9534,  1.5215, -0.8951, -2.3195, -0.9215])

The roast turkey sandwich was just that. | tensor([ 7.9249, -1.9653, -2.7808, -3.0835,  0.9642, -0.6958, -2.2760, -0.8181])

Not out of this world, but not bad. | tensor([ 8.5109, -2.1608, -1.5320, -2.6662, -0.8280, -1.2864, -1.9323, -1.0644])

My biggest complaint was the service. | tensor([ 8.5397, -2.2253, -2.3220, -2.6963, -0.0145, -2.2551, -1.4942, -0.5663])

It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch. | tensor([ 7.8801, -0.6891, -1.9234, -1.2156, -1.7834, -2.2925, -2.3345,  0.0946])

This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. | tensor([ 8.4445, -1.6676, -2.5364, -1.7335, -0.5952, -2.5674, -2.2457,  0.2669])
The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. | tensor([ 8.3418, -1.8078, -1.8807, -2.0686, -0.6379, -1.9876, -2.5853, -0.3078])
I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area. | tensor([ 8.6986, -2.1062, -2.1844, -2.6505, -0.2225, -1.6546, -2.1663, -0.3603])

Service can be hit or miss. | tensor([ 8.5030, -2.3473, -1.7714, -2.6636, -0.7001, -2.3099, -1.5819, -0.2269])
Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! | tensor([ 8.6674, -2.4316, -2.1859, -2.3439, -0.1326, -1.9027, -1.6049, -1.0762])

Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\n2. | tensor([ 8.3606, -2.5819, -2.0600, -1.8931, -0.2308, -1.3996, -1.4915, -1.4682])

Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\n Would not recommend to anyone. | tensor([ 8.4465, -1.9024, -2.4424, -1.8667, -0.0862, -2.6748, -2.0465, -0.3188])

My sweet pea risotto was just OK. | tensor([ 8.2713, -1.5169, -2.6874, -2.0754, -0.1305, -1.8024, -2.1841, -0.3809])
My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. | tensor([ 7.2012, -0.7986, -3.2041, -2.8173,  2.3803, -1.9993, -2.1801, -0.4163])
Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. | tensor([ 8.5019, -1.8708, -2.3967, -2.5380, -0.3234, -1.8154, -1.7911, -0.4554])

Four ravioli for the same?\n\nThey altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.\n\nService was attentive and the setting nice. | tensor([ 8.3918, -2.7512, -1.5128, -2.5489, -1.0124, -0.8730, -1.5219, -1.0687])

The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. | tensor([ 8.0523, -1.6843, -2.7081, -2.8132,  0.2568, -1.2279, -1.9510, -0.6922])

This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \n\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. | tensor([ 8.2519, -2.3506, -1.8622, -1.5924, -0.6890, -2.5083, -2.0745, -0.0253])
I don't get it. | tensor([ 8.5725, -2.3735, -1.9777, -2.3941, -0.4230, -1.7372, -1.6718, -0.7264])
I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. | tensor([ 8.5246, -1.8867, -2.5596, -1.8618, -0.3759, -2.2751, -1.9972, -0.3106])
\n\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer. | tensor([ 4.7435, -0.7097, -1.2644, -0.9777,  0.9648,  0.2522, -2.3127, -1.3661])

The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. | tensor([ 8.4591, -2.1815, -2.3103, -1.8525, -0.3892, -2.2089, -2.1290, -0.1753])

I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. | tensor([ 8.6498, -2.3780, -2.0567, -2.5378, -0.2629, -1.8766, -1.5838, -0.9728])
The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish. | tensor([ 5.2550, -0.6516, -2.3320, -1.8894,  2.6958, -0.0694, -3.3673, -0.6663])

Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. | tensor([ 6.6893, -1.1971, -2.2638, -1.7258,  1.3469, -0.8442, -3.2601, -0.4774])
I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. | tensor([ 8.6793, -2.2108, -1.9052, -2.6268, -0.5940, -1.7938, -1.6588, -0.7519])
The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. | tensor([ 6.7798, -2.9425, -1.6092, -3.2100,  0.5950,  0.8855, -2.2936, -0.2133])
\n\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy | tensor([ 1.6442,  0.6684, -2.8455, -2.5124,  7.7092, -0.7742, -2.7843,  0.0517])
and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. | tensor([ 8.4090, -1.7516, -2.2912, -2.6218, -0.6870, -1.2611, -2.1957, -0.2908])
\n\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag. | tensor([ 8.3159, -1.9178, -1.6624, -2.3878, -0.9206, -1.9258, -2.3200, -0.1582])
I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. | tensor([ 6.2720, -1.8849, -1.6176, -3.5273, -0.6395, -0.0272, -2.8424,  2.5333])
It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \n\nFood: \n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory | tensor([ 7.2891, -1.7862, -2.4352, -0.9212, -0.8002, -0.3413, -1.5989, -1.1249])
and I would definitely order it again\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. | tensor([ 7.6635, -1.0896, -2.6342, -1.3330, -0.2502, -1.3877, -2.5000, -0.7082])
I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. | tensor([ 8.3824, -2.0919, -1.5086, -2.2662, -1.1541, -1.2407, -2.3991, -0.2251])
I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. | tensor([ 6.6335, -1.6752, -2.7429, -0.8687,  0.6251, -0.5779, -2.6422, -0.1612])
I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,   | tensor([ 7.0817, -1.0449, -2.8934, -1.2860,  0.5300, -1.1977, -1.6563, -1.1453])

The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\n\nService: Not terrible. | tensor([ 7.6043, -1.5624, -2.6114, -2.4954,  0.3833, -1.4670, -2.4412,  0.0182])
I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. | tensor([ 5.2180, -3.1264,  2.2110, -2.4537, -2.2110, -0.0338, -0.4909, -1.8876])
I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. | tensor([ 8.5713, -2.3963, -2.4361, -1.8975,  0.1911, -2.2543, -1.6579, -1.0079])
They were very accommodating in this way. | tensor([ 8.3975, -1.4367, -2.3383, -2.2036, -0.5031, -1.7440, -2.1249, -0.6858])
\n\nWill I go back? | tensor([ 8.4578, -1.9328, -2.0772, -2.3996, -0.1084, -1.8745, -2.2511, -0.4549])

I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. | tensor([ 8.5078, -1.7163, -2.3610, -2.5334, -0.2647, -2.1352, -2.2087, -0.0998])
She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.\n\nI knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group... | tensor([ 1.9120, -1.0773, -2.7438, -2.5771,  7.7556, -1.3587, -2.7109,  0.9238])
Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype. | tensor([ 8.5945, -2.0941, -2.2313, -2.4163, -0.6529, -1.5199, -1.7508, -0.5996])

And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. | tensor([ 1.2634,  4.3130, -3.4057,  1.2370, -0.5440, -0.1221,  1.5374, -2.9654])
The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.\n\nThe service was good. | tensor([ 8.6359, -2.5244, -2.1530, -2.4840, -0.4315, -1.8450, -1.0617, -1.2079])
Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.\n\nThe menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings. | tensor([ 5.4785,  3.0824, -3.2270, -0.1871, -0.5459, -1.6482, -2.2123, -1.2353])

For a beverage, we both opted for just water.\n\nI have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed. | tensor([ 8.4039, -1.4771, -2.8750, -2.4496, -0.1946, -2.4344, -1.6344, -0.1045])

The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.\n\nI can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. | tensor([ 7.1045,  0.2028, -2.5067, -1.5218, -0.7204, -1.9811, -2.5282,  0.0422])
She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.\n\nThe Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. | tensor([ 7.6340, -0.5550, -2.7032, -2.4503, -0.1155, -1.8343, -2.5549,  0.5082])
The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.   | tensor([ 5.9753, -0.1320, -2.3596, -1.5140,  0.8293, -0.6204, -2.6291, -1.0682])
It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\n\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\n\nSeriously? | tensor([ 8.0022, -1.5663, -2.5961, -1.2942, -0.7957, -2.0229, -0.6284, -1.4958])

As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers. | tensor([ 3.1132, -0.9408, -2.8085,  0.2939,  2.6970, -0.7690, -1.0266, -1.4361])

The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \"cured egg yolk\" which was infused in the avacado sauce. | tensor([ 2.6430, -1.5597,  0.4713, -0.9712, -2.1676,  4.2587, -1.5907, -1.2942])

the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... | tensor([ 6.7518, -1.8309, -0.8868, -2.2988,  0.0779, -0.6151, -3.2152, -0.1029])
probably my favorite part of the meal. | tensor([ 7.5397, -1.0871, -2.4958, -2.1465, -0.0946, -1.5277, -3.1210,  0.6565])
both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.\ni love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.\ni'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus! | tensor([ 7.9769, -1.7483, -2.8019, -1.5523,  0.1091, -0.9474, -2.1125, -1.3066])
Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. | tensor([ 8.0679, -1.2977, -2.2380, -2.1662, -0.6556, -2.9628, -2.4842,  1.1826])
Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. | tensor([ 5.6544, -1.5963, -2.3594,  0.0909,  0.4716, -0.5348, -2.8653, -0.2725])
The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. | tensor([ 6.8691, -1.3458, -2.7217, -1.2246,  0.5880, -1.2141, -2.4372, -0.4353])
The menu is so inventive! | tensor([ 8.1640, -1.5843, -2.3207, -1.9297, -0.6385, -1.2758, -2.1438, -0.8126])
My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. | tensor([ 3.7215, -1.4481, -1.8337, -3.8690,  3.8332, -0.8156, -3.8926,  2.9995])
It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. | tensor([ 2.3642, -1.4431, -0.3888, -2.9788, -1.8156,  6.1608, -2.4438,  0.4534])
\n\nThis time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. | tensor([ 8.1734, -1.5377, -2.4349, -2.3726, -0.3928, -1.9115, -2.2176,  0.0399])
It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. | tensor([ 8.2700, -2.2766, -2.1470, -1.5992, -0.4158, -1.9240, -1.9620, -0.4714])
My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. | tensor([ 6.6454, -2.0908, -1.4253, -2.9033, -0.7587,  0.6765, -1.0183, -0.6127])
It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.\n\nFor dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. | tensor([ 6.6508, -1.9336, -3.0847, -3.2383,  2.7576, -0.3422, -2.3317, -0.7618])
I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream. | tensor([ 3.8620, -0.3881, -1.6735, -1.1394,  1.9634,  1.2344, -2.7663, -0.8446])

The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent. | tensor([ 7.2189, -1.2101, -2.4992, -2.5495,  1.0263, -0.6329, -2.9065, -0.6759])
Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\n\nBit of a complex review.   | tensor([ 8.5319, -1.9906, -2.3260, -2.3903, -0.6504, -1.4487, -2.1077, -0.3306])
My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes. | tensor([ 8.1130, -2.3374, -0.6287, -2.4996, -1.1974, -1.4081, -2.5222, -0.5055])

One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine. | tensor([-0.4045, -2.9710,  7.2923, -2.9908, -1.5939,  1.3728, -2.0107, -0.4225])
 Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.   | tensor([ 0.5654,  0.4608, -2.2943,  6.7092,  0.2860, -0.8262, -2.0597, -2.2671])
Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint. | tensor([-0.3888, -2.7663,  7.1683, -2.7746, -1.8781,  0.8368, -1.4811, -0.3120])

I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced. | tensor([ 5.1318, -3.5362,  3.7083, -1.9947, -1.8979, -1.1161, -2.5941, -0.7131])

As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. | tensor([ 7.6401, -1.7348, -2.3973, -1.9469,  0.5789, -1.3497, -2.0270, -1.3318])
So lots of food! | tensor([ 7.5298, -1.9639, -0.7633, -2.4717, -0.2510, -0.9510, -2.6665, -1.2998])

All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following. | tensor([ 8.3404, -2.2259, -1.8089, -2.1577, -1.1252, -1.4018, -1.8168, -0.7256])
When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! | tensor([ 8.5594, -2.1388, -2.5017, -2.4342,  0.2771, -2.5002, -1.6801, -0.3700])
Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. | tensor([ 5.4484, -2.5262, -2.0635, -1.6927, -1.9227,  2.6673, -2.1699,  0.9705])
I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! | tensor([ 1.8581,  1.6639, -0.9696, -1.8550, -3.0792,  4.2067, -1.3216,  0.2307])
Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately. | tensor([ 6.0860, -1.5658, -3.1855, -1.0705,  2.1908, -1.4586, -1.8900, -1.3024])
 \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. | tensor([ 8.3836, -2.0523, -2.3845, -1.5763, -0.5972, -2.2132, -2.1261, -0.3163])
Waters were re-filled quickly. | tensor([ 8.2984, -2.0487, -1.7941, -2.9793, -0.5689, -2.0575, -2.1647,  0.8959])
Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. | tensor([ 7.7975, -1.7880, -2.2432, -2.6086,  0.5544, -1.9150, -2.0180, -0.4517])
The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? | tensor([ 0.5133, -2.6063,  6.0224, -1.9480, -0.8117, -1.3573, -2.0591, -0.2802])

Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. | tensor([ 8.6253, -2.2115, -2.3107, -2.2337, -0.4859, -2.1194, -1.4640, -0.6832])
None of the eight dishes disappointed! | tensor([ 8.0508, -2.6589, -2.7236, -2.3606,  1.8006, -1.8491, -1.1772, -1.7219])
The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. | tensor([ 8.4146, -1.6642, -2.3383, -2.5067, -0.6401, -1.5560, -1.9928, -0.1800])
The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. | tensor([ 5.4937, -0.3155, -1.2550, -0.4014, -2.0682,  1.5092, -2.4341, -1.3541])
I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. | tensor([ 7.3665, -0.2884, -2.3844, -3.2929,  0.0529,  0.0714, -2.7878, -0.4314])
It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. | tensor([ 5.8445, -1.6141, -2.6716, -0.4109,  1.4943, -1.1066, -2.3384, -0.5182])
The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. | tensor([ 8.1736, -1.8190, -2.1022, -2.2693, -0.5331, -1.3431, -2.5836, -0.4458])
Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. | tensor([ 1.3487, -1.9148, -0.4910, -3.4091, -0.3718,  6.9359, -2.0801,  0.0285])
Both were cooked to perfection. | tensor([ 8.5051, -2.3403, -2.2124, -2.7658, -0.1545, -1.6248, -1.9781, -0.2727])
The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. | tensor([ 7.9910, -1.6602, -2.7356, -1.9752,  0.0122, -1.5952, -1.6568, -1.0425])
However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. | tensor([ 7.0444, -1.5534, -2.7485, -2.2264,  1.0394, -0.4434, -2.0434, -1.2670])
I really can't hold this against Casbah though. | tensor([ 8.5051, -1.8932, -2.3885, -2.7347,  0.1933, -2.0724, -2.2300, -0.1911])
I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! | tensor([ 4.3310,  0.0465, -3.1086, -0.2052,  3.3136, -1.4690, -2.4567, -0.9535])
The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. | tensor([ 8.3834, -1.8299, -1.9829, -3.4389, -0.6447, -1.3923, -1.7216,  0.0455])
The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. | tensor([ 8.1414, -1.2541, -2.3578, -2.4514,  0.0503, -1.7385, -2.6732, -0.1730])
I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. | tensor([ 8.5916, -1.4839, -2.2399, -2.4375, -1.0397, -1.7916, -2.1079, -0.1310])
A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. | tensor([ 8.3350, -2.2814, -2.2812, -2.1565,  0.0177, -1.9991, -2.2533, -0.0475])
The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! | tensor([ 6.3763, -0.9219, -2.2732, -2.9305, -0.5181, -2.0217, -2.8401,  3.4753])
Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. | tensor([ 8.4783, -1.8881, -2.4733, -2.0559,  0.1373, -2.2521, -2.2452, -0.2118])

I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. | tensor([ 8.4942, -1.6896, -2.6267, -1.7287, -0.3860, -2.3497, -2.0232, -0.3156])

My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.\n\nMake sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.\n\nAlthough I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. | tensor([ 7.7804, -1.1527, -2.5206, -2.2439, -0.2784, -1.7905, -2.1657, -0.1957])

I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place. | tensor([ 8.4811, -1.2191, -2.0158, -2.9692, -1.0575, -1.1706, -2.4700, -0.0699])
Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. | tensor([ 8.6531, -2.0784, -2.4497, -2.4160, -0.1430, -2.3396, -1.2514, -0.7242])

We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. | tensor([ 8.5194, -2.5745, -1.7197, -2.4625, -0.4217, -1.8022, -1.5552, -0.9993])
Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. | tensor([ 8.4158, -2.4669, -2.1820, -2.3876, -0.2711, -1.8700, -1.5515, -0.6800])

My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. | tensor([ 8.6579, -2.2612, -2.2613, -2.5288,  0.1905, -2.4675, -1.4483, -0.8937])

Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\n\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.   | tensor([ 0.7164, -0.7580, -2.6413, -2.5120,  7.5360, -0.5650, -1.3183, -0.3412])
In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough. | tensor([ 8.0893, -1.4045, -1.8704, -2.5666, -1.0430, -1.2502, -2.2452, -0.3637])

However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.\n\nAs with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door! | tensor([ 7.1205,  0.4319, -2.0676, -1.4082, -0.4723, -3.0223, -1.7135, -0.5311])
I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... | tensor([ 8.4534, -2.2426, -2.0642, -2.1905, -0.5220, -2.1822, -2.0809, -0.0218])

So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. | tensor([ 8.5851, -2.0807, -2.0492, -2.5086, -0.4144, -2.0269, -2.0174, -0.4867])

I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.\n\nWe returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. | tensor([ 8.3396, -1.9194, -2.4325, -1.8063, -1.0043, -1.8472, -2.0763,  0.1795])

While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, \"My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop.\" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.\n\nFinally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. | tensor([ 8.3065, -1.9120, -2.4881, -1.9740, -0.7147, -2.2804, -2.0172,  0.4265])

I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. | tensor([ 7.8356, -1.2081, -2.8404, -1.7336,  0.0668, -2.3238, -3.0459,  0.9466])

Best \"Babaganoush\" we've had since we visited Egypt.\nThe gaspacho soup was fantastic, and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli, I can only assume they were suburb also. | tensor([ 7.6253, -2.7905, -0.8158, -2.3215, -1.4183, -0.0841, -1.4768, -1.0925])

Cleaned the plate!\n\nI had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! | tensor([ 7.2056, -1.0184, -3.2017, -3.1147,  1.4674, -0.7152, -1.7039, -0.9904])
My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.\n\nAnd the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! | tensor([ 4.9980, -0.6211, -2.8439, -0.9347,  2.0838, -0.5183, -2.0022, -0.9927])
I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... | tensor([ 8.4510, -2.1101, -2.2660, -2.4324,  0.2709, -1.3583, -2.2449, -0.8604])
I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen! | tensor([ 1.7030, -1.3619, -2.5022, -2.5739,  8.4003, -1.5582, -2.0914,  0.2971])
Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm. | tensor([ 8.4715, -2.3013, -2.1525, -2.3035, -0.2505, -1.7287, -1.9839, -0.6208])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. | tensor([ 6.7265, -2.0924, -1.9813, -1.8171,  0.4746, -1.9111, -2.1685,  0.0852])
It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. | tensor([ 8.5706, -1.4829, -2.1527, -2.7536, -0.5384, -1.9267, -2.4541,  0.1682])
\n\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. | tensor([ 1.2439,  1.3490, -3.1090, -2.0298, -0.8522, -0.8313,  1.7305,  2.6661])
While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. | tensor([ 8.6907, -1.9850, -2.2146, -2.3814, -0.7006, -2.1743, -1.6824, -0.1589])
\n\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. | tensor([ 1.3594, -2.8984, -0.8215, -2.9052,  0.4981,  6.4351, -1.7979, -0.3822])
We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. | tensor([ 7.6089, -2.0762, -1.5996, -2.3925,  0.3576, -1.2362, -2.4491, -0.8468])
The spread was ok. | tensor([ 8.6930, -2.2909, -1.5996, -2.8342, -0.8224, -1.8122, -1.4388, -0.8061])
\n\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\n\nFor the cavereccia | tensor([ 7.6505, -1.6555, -1.8036, -2.1694, -0.7879, -0.4707, -1.9734, -1.0286])
I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab | tensor([ 8.3098, -1.1998, -2.0798, -3.3191, -0.8133, -0.8988, -1.7393, -0.5751])
but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. | tensor([ 8.4842, -1.6275, -2.1656, -3.0117, -0.7624, -1.1850, -1.5887, -0.5701])
The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\n\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. | tensor([ 8.3077, -1.6805, -2.3606, -1.5129, -1.3917, -1.8766, -1.6882, -0.3517])
The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. | tensor([ 7.0772, -0.2107, -1.5202, -3.6331, -2.5840, -0.1854, -1.9209,  1.3484])
I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. | tensor([ 2.1530,  0.4578, -2.5609, -3.8811,  3.7308,  1.2966, -1.7417,  0.7782])
\n\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. | tensor([ 6.4156, -0.9205, -2.8753, -2.4455,  0.8474,  0.5456, -2.8874, -0.3549])
It was pretty good | tensor([ 8.6227, -1.9089, -2.1300, -2.4863, -0.3790, -1.8726, -2.2464, -0.3277])
but I wish there were more raspberries in it. | tensor([ 8.0604, -1.9078, -2.2950, -2.3452, -0.3576, -1.6508, -2.4828,  0.4791])
\n\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. | tensor([ 8.2263, -1.6038, -2.4792, -2.4210, -0.3976, -1.6695, -2.3580, -0.1506])
\n\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price. | tensor([ 8.6686, -1.8964, -1.5079, -2.3634, -1.3908, -1.8473, -1.9774, -0.6106])
I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. | tensor([ 5.9194, -1.2516, -1.5303, -3.1795,  1.0629, -2.3337, -3.7693,  3.1101])
We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. | tensor([ 8.6352, -1.5221, -2.3194, -2.1528, -0.7005, -1.8604, -2.4235, -0.3692])
Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. | tensor([ 8.6078, -2.2108, -2.3360, -2.6032,  0.2175, -2.1617, -1.5989, -0.8230])
I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. | tensor([ 7.8934, -1.6891, -2.7854, -3.0779,  2.0606, -2.1247, -2.7025, -0.0788])
We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. | tensor([ 8.3287, -2.0598, -2.6807, -2.5061, -0.0319, -1.1393, -2.1817, -0.3785])
We started off with the papardelle. | tensor([ 8.3890, -2.1924, -2.0539, -2.7282, -0.7776, -2.0035, -1.3441, -0.2754])
The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! | tensor([ 8.3594, -1.5052, -1.8588, -2.4078, -0.7672, -1.5488, -2.5597, -0.3308])
For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. | tensor([ 7.8468, -1.9759, -2.0881, -2.4747, -0.5561, -0.6485, -1.4976, -1.0488])
His words to describe the duck were \"life changing\". | tensor([ 8.4641, -1.4490, -2.4845, -2.3802, -0.4614, -1.8754, -1.7961, -0.5631])
I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. | tensor([ 8.6007, -2.0581, -2.2276, -2.3418, -0.4880, -1.9598, -2.0794, -0.2447])
The short rib was so tender and juicy. | tensor([ 6.3638,  0.0575, -3.0907, -2.4843,  2.1625, -1.6099, -3.1013,  0.1591])
I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. | tensor([ 8.3790, -2.1426, -1.8923, -2.8279, -0.4556, -1.3088, -1.9204, -0.6368])
It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! | tensor([ 7.7673, -1.9495, -0.5838, -2.2566, -2.0974, -0.5410, -2.1552, -0.5922])
For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. | tensor([ 8.3006, -2.1236, -2.2418, -2.5566,  0.2839, -1.6992, -2.2697, -0.5828])
It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. | tensor([ 8.2406, -1.8475, -2.1211, -2.6722,  0.5440, -2.0889, -2.2496, -0.7020])
I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have! | tensor([ 6.5930, -1.1393, -1.8933, -2.8100, -0.0618, -1.1949, -3.4498,  1.9770])
This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. | tensor([ 3.0851, -2.4346,  0.4853, -2.8872, -1.3176,  1.2729, -2.1907,  2.4114])
The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. | tensor([ 8.1984, -2.1292, -2.7779, -2.6773,  1.5081, -2.3330, -1.8784, -0.7053])
We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. | tensor([ 7.5735, -0.7257, -2.6463, -2.2606, -0.9254, -1.9338, -2.1815,  0.2302])
This is the only negative point I have about the meal.\n\nWe ordered the cheese  tasting menu, the duck, the scallop pasta, and the lemon sponge cake. | tensor([ 8.3591, -2.0089, -2.6759, -2.6218,  0.9828, -2.0371, -1.6941, -1.1698])
Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. | tensor([ 7.8900, -1.7163, -2.6103, -2.3806,  0.0141, -0.9335, -2.5669,  0.0264])
The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. | tensor([ 4.5505, -2.3104, -2.2627, -0.2099,  3.3857, -0.7423, -2.3888, -1.4951])
We left feeling full and happy. | tensor([ 8.6900, -2.0839, -2.0977, -2.8470, -0.1684, -2.0042, -1.9049, -0.5015])
This update is for Casbah's brunch.\n\nAlright, Casbah. | tensor([ 8.5376, -2.5425, -2.0622, -2.1226, -0.2890, -2.2442, -1.4844, -0.8770])
You got me, you got me good. | tensor([ 8.2528, -1.9313, -2.4841, -2.9911,  0.7522, -1.3020, -2.3901, -0.7030])
Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. | tensor([ 8.6616, -2.3996, -2.2776, -2.3354, -0.1313, -1.9011, -1.8680, -0.6443])
Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. | tensor([ 7.5307, -1.6364, -1.5074, -2.3364, -1.4231, -2.2506, -2.8280,  1.6628])
I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. | tensor([ 8.3975, -1.7332, -2.2789, -1.9944, -0.9576, -2.0106, -2.1159,  0.0615])
Brother Brunch gets the nod here.\n\nBrunch is basically a fixed set. | tensor([ 8.0727, -1.0536, -1.8741, -1.8329, -1.3017, -1.7926, -1.3985, -0.8459])
For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. | tensor([ 7.4274, -1.6526, -2.6327, -1.5604,  0.1430, -2.5028, -2.0882,  0.1432])
They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. | tensor([ 4.4932, -3.4452,  0.0932, -1.7164, -1.0225,  1.9982, -0.5499, -1.9154])
Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. | tensor([ 7.6754, -0.5017, -3.1839, -2.6031,  1.3431, -1.6615, -2.0373, -1.2141])
For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. | tensor([ 7.9358, -1.7443, -2.5120, -2.4773,  0.1258, -1.4415, -2.2474, -0.5291])
\n\nSMOKED SALMON: | tensor([ 7.7419, -2.8295, -2.3736, -2.4992,  0.1990,  0.0598, -1.1358, -1.7824])
If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. | tensor([ 4.4718,  1.5619, -2.6689,  0.6198,  0.2580, -2.9796, -3.3683,  1.2534])
It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! | tensor([ 8.1793, -1.1852, -2.2511, -2.8227, -0.0249, -1.2102, -2.5565, -0.6251])
no, there's too much of something I like,\" said nobody ever. | tensor([ 8.4642, -2.1587, -1.9356, -1.9925, -0.6925, -1.6142, -2.0180, -0.6609])
Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! | tensor([ 8.5835, -1.4637, -2.4158, -2.4998, -0.5047, -2.0546, -1.8893, -0.2493])
\n\nSEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. | tensor([ 5.4320, -2.2980,  0.0476, -1.4560, -1.9962,  3.1577, -2.0625, -2.3221])
The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. | tensor([ 2.4898, -2.2577, -0.7538, -1.2584,  0.6820,  4.3745, -1.1508, -2.8058])
I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. | tensor([ 7.8001, -1.8444, -2.0028, -2.4349,  0.2963, -0.7792, -1.8078, -1.7199])
It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. | tensor([ 8.0451, -2.1095, -2.3626, -2.4770,  0.5962, -1.1737, -2.1831, -1.0990])
\n\nAll in all, fantastic brunch experience. | tensor([ 8.3606, -2.4814, -2.2448, -2.6763,  0.2260, -1.1637, -1.8503, -1.1826])
Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \"I-regret-this-decision-immediately\" kind of way. | tensor([ 8.5075, -2.0002, -2.6509, -2.6506,  0.6776, -1.9324, -1.7062, -1.2683])
Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served. | tensor([ 3.4875, -2.1503, -2.7973, -2.0589,  5.0903, -0.4850, -1.8176, -0.8310])
While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today. | tensor([ 6.1290, -0.9951, -2.9845, -2.2411,  2.8017, -1.4799, -2.4480, -0.7322])
 \n\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. | tensor([ 7.5516, -1.1277, -2.5769, -1.8453, -0.2816, -0.4219, -1.6110, -1.6281])
I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. | tensor([ 7.6746, -1.6928, -2.9093, -2.6265,  1.1147, -2.2479, -0.0770, -1.8749])
The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. | tensor([ 8.6571, -2.3223, -2.3436, -2.3950, -0.0385, -2.0802, -1.3394, -0.9067])
However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. | tensor([ 8.6655, -1.8868, -2.3169, -2.9314, -0.1025, -1.8671, -1.7837, -0.5541])
\n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. | tensor([ 8.6082, -1.4817, -2.3956, -2.4621, -0.6620, -2.0454, -2.1622, -0.0472])
I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially). | tensor([ 8.3176, -1.7293, -2.5854, -2.0402, -0.0609, -1.9355, -2.0637, -0.6863])
    Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. | tensor([ 8.6449, -2.4346, -2.2081, -2.9447, -0.0891, -1.4893, -1.5190, -0.8668])
I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. | tensor([ 8.4374, -1.9239, -2.5284, -2.3482, -0.0231, -2.0908, -2.0599,  0.0463])
I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 6.7332, -1.3736, -1.2149, -3.1579, -1.6331, -1.3013, -3.0464,  2.7690])
I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. | tensor([ 8.0686, -2.2238, -1.9294, -1.4988, -0.8510, -1.4883, -2.1916, -0.4271])
I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. | tensor([ 8.6198, -2.2856, -2.2238, -2.6602,  0.1511, -2.1606, -1.7392, -0.6969])
\n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... | tensor([ 8.5412, -1.8581, -1.8060, -2.6642, -0.5913, -1.6985, -2.4935, -0.0247])
I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. | tensor([ 7.8765, -1.7824, -1.4307, -2.6357, -0.7062, -1.9643, -2.9778,  0.8833])
In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. | tensor([ 8.5387, -1.8422, -1.9914, -1.6913, -0.9976, -2.0983, -2.3408, -0.3117])
\n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. | tensor([ 8.6550, -2.2828, -2.1815, -2.3251, -0.2488, -2.1326, -1.3216, -1.1145])
No thanks Casbah! | tensor([ 8.2362, -2.1982, -2.2604, -2.9499,  0.5085, -1.5833, -2.2664, -0.3596])
Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... | tensor([ 8.4792, -2.3824, -1.7087, -2.1562, -0.8027, -2.1504, -1.6186, -0.5072])
it is SOOO good! | tensor([ 7.9480, -2.7872, -0.9411, -2.2311, -0.2098, -1.3020, -2.1775, -1.0781])
The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. | tensor([ 8.3465, -1.5136, -2.6667, -2.2756, -0.1778, -1.8791, -2.2312, -0.2572])
Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. | tensor([ 5.9746, -1.8696,  1.9724, -1.8340, -3.2441, -1.4185, -3.0067,  0.9276])
The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. | tensor([ 7.8482, -2.3037, -1.5426, -1.8200, -0.9965, -0.7836, -1.4780, -1.3434])
As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. | tensor([ 8.2540, -2.2567, -2.4675, -2.6734, -0.7701, -1.6338, -1.7279,  0.6164])
It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal. | tensor([ 8.5838, -2.1682, -2.5967, -2.4597,  0.3982, -1.8599, -1.9761, -0.7241])
Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit. | tensor([ 7.1896, -1.5458, -1.8790, -1.5067, -1.5088, -0.3275, -2.7451,  0.3917])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.   | tensor([ 8.5080, -1.8509, -2.5139, -2.6127, -0.0691, -2.4036, -1.9467,  0.1039])
I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\n\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread. | tensor([ 2.7941, -3.7538,  4.4260, -2.0454, -1.8767,  1.2878, -1.5476, -1.5583])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.   | tensor([ 6.7743, -0.2674, -1.9405, -2.3317,  0.5775, -1.7097, -2.2692, -0.7141])
We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious. | tensor([ 8.0574, -1.7725, -2.4763, -2.0860,  0.4307, -1.1214, -2.5957, -0.7906])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients. | tensor([ 7.7314, -2.3779, -1.4662, -2.5304, -0.8774, -0.6084, -1.1126, -1.1820])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.   | tensor([ 2.9442,  0.4427, -1.9258,  0.1570,  2.6269, -0.7078, -3.1454, -0.5506])
Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony. | tensor([ 8.1266, -1.9426, -2.4108, -1.6702, -0.4013, -1.5891, -2.2868, -0.5317])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers. | tensor([ 7.9197, -1.6559, -2.6043, -2.7145,  0.1491, -1.3228, -2.4756, -0.0601])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\n\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively. | tensor([ 8.4172, -2.1806, -2.2442, -1.6312, -0.3671, -2.0903, -1.9003, -1.0634])
 Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!   | tensor([ 7.9531, -1.7657, -2.3981, -2.4439,  0.0691, -1.9114, -2.5339,  0.3811])
The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it. | tensor([ 7.7681, -0.6063, -2.7597, -2.9697,  0.3415, -1.0117, -2.5171, -0.4625])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there. | tensor([ 7.9332, -1.3913, -1.8326, -1.9961, -0.8858, -1.5537, -3.1591,  0.3305])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures. | tensor([ 8.1751, -1.6020, -2.3681, -1.5638, -0.8803, -1.8034, -2.5867,  0.0775])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!   | tensor([ 8.5140, -1.6481, -2.4403, -2.2718, -0.5796, -1.6261, -2.1429, -0.4600])
Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\n\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.   | tensor([ 3.7448, -1.5553, -2.8327, -1.1012,  4.7434, -1.4838, -2.1336, -0.7246])
Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba. | tensor([ 8.1547, -1.6436, -2.7791, -2.2625,  0.2575, -2.0880, -2.0769, -0.1426])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing! | tensor([ 7.9543, -1.3990, -2.7367, -3.2370,  1.5031, -1.8742, -2.5493,  0.1808])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. | tensor([ 7.5431, -1.4661, -2.2494, -1.7228, -0.2147, -1.0749, -2.4620, -0.3472])
Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \"Happy birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.   | tensor([ 8.0816, -1.2670, -2.7604, -2.6350,  0.2842, -2.2662, -2.5856,  0.5512])
My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote. | tensor([ 8.4920, -2.3154, -2.4098, -2.4961,  0.1122, -2.0650, -1.3668, -0.9034])
 Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\n\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.   | tensor([ 8.2339, -1.9565, -2.2299, -1.9705, -0.8031, -1.6975, -1.5798, -0.5431])
We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit. | tensor([ 7.6709, -1.8391, -2.1284, -2.0245, -1.1652, -1.0055, -1.8526, -0.5667])

At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\n\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.   | tensor([ 7.9925, -1.8115, -2.1652, -2.3271, -0.3943, -1.8597, -2.3336,  0.1373])
The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant. | tensor([ 8.4226, -1.8804, -2.4243, -2.1623, -0.2403, -1.9391, -2.1544, -0.4187])

I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it. | tensor([ 7.2830, -1.5412, -1.8057, -2.3713, -1.4534,  1.1640, -2.3133, -0.6836])

I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners! | tensor([ 8.5830, -2.0415, -2.5663, -2.6613,  0.0686, -1.6141, -1.7172, -0.8597])
Three strikes and you're out! | tensor([ 8.5116, -2.3183, -2.4630, -2.8460, -0.1185, -1.8399, -0.9053, -0.8430])

We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.   | tensor([ 7.8598, -1.3119, -1.2966, -2.9020, -1.9888, -1.2619, -2.5003,  0.7113])
That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. | tensor([ 8.6335, -2.0625, -2.3270, -2.4349, -0.1044, -2.3433, -1.5523, -0.7808])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.   | tensor([ 8.1162, -1.7451, -0.7585, -2.9370, -1.6509, -0.9723, -2.3820, -0.3899])
We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. | tensor([ 8.5981, -2.0388, -1.9469, -2.7349, -0.7625, -1.6277, -2.0653, -0.0300])

I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. | tensor([ 4.0135,  1.1686, -2.5704, -1.8622, -0.0362, -0.4868, -1.0439,  0.1364])

I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. | tensor([ 8.5617, -1.5456, -2.3184, -2.5397, -0.6770, -2.3773, -2.3138,  0.3731])

I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. | tensor([ 8.4450, -1.7169, -2.5840, -2.9303,  0.1307, -1.6796, -2.0588, -0.1639])

When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.   | tensor([ 8.4686, -1.3020, -2.4345, -2.8601, -0.5009, -1.6261, -2.1954,  0.1141])
Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. | tensor([ 8.5063, -2.1099, -2.1803, -2.6323,  0.7873, -2.1958, -2.0548, -0.5546])

Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex? | tensor([ 8.4766, -2.0132, -2.4595, -1.9617, -0.5731, -2.2262, -1.8210, -0.2810])
Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. | tensor([ 8.1388, -1.9154, -1.2683, -2.9543, -1.3707, -1.4873, -2.8138,  0.8207])
High quality service and creative dishes. | tensor([ 8.2588, -1.9890, -2.5342, -2.4340,  0.3370, -1.1726, -2.1795, -1.0970])
Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount. | tensor([ 8.4484, -1.9280, -2.1975, -2.4977, -0.6459, -1.3506, -2.2185, -0.2848])
 \n\nMust try:\nCalamari\nCheese plate\nShort Rib Ravioli\nPork | tensor([ 8.4161, -2.7682, -2.0929, -2.4442, -0.3578, -1.4551, -0.8842, -1.3866])
Chop\nWatermelon Gin Fizz | tensor([ 8.4077, -1.5112, -2.6656, -2.5193,  0.3507, -1.9890, -2.1270, -0.4986])
Mixed results.   | tensor([ 8.5189, -2.3284, -2.2070, -2.5860,  0.0703, -1.8875, -1.7157, -0.6295])
Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. | tensor([ 8.2100, -2.5623, -2.1749, -1.9671, -0.8823, -1.0309, -1.4206, -1.1883])
Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? | tensor([ 8.5067, -2.2156, -2.4634, -1.9346, -0.0894, -2.2454, -1.4515, -1.0709])
Methinks not. | tensor([ 8.5762, -2.5470, -2.1492, -2.5811, -0.0697, -1.8617, -1.4678, -0.9032])

I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). | tensor([ 5.5570, -3.2141, -2.9253, -1.0356,  1.6563, -0.5921, -1.8548,  0.1407])
Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. | tensor([ 8.2474, -2.1807, -2.2474, -2.2331, -0.8653, -1.6774, -1.7899, -0.1563])
\n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.   | tensor([ 6.4695, -0.5960, -2.1893, -0.2921, -0.1925, -1.3493, -1.3844, -1.9054])
The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.   | tensor([ 2.2697, -0.8096,  0.3312, -3.2673, -2.5786,  3.7343, -0.6663,  0.7193])
We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. | tensor([ 6.5258, -0.9144, -2.5159, -1.4507,  1.0807, -1.7071, -2.8138, -0.1997])
I expect a better overall experience for the money. | tensor([ 8.6333, -2.2126, -2.1672, -2.7736, -0.2704, -1.5703, -1.7239, -0.8701])
Though I didn't get a chance to visit this place when I visited last month, I really do love Quiet Storm and I will be sure I hit it up next time I'm in town visiting my friends there. | tensor([ 8.5128, -1.6739, -2.0537, -2.0630, -1.2035, -1.4522, -2.2717, -0.2553])
The decor is adorable. | tensor([ 8.5262e+00, -2.3893e+00, -2.1269e+00, -2.7918e+00,  4.1767e-03,
        -1.3993e+00, -1.9823e+00, -7.5417e-01])
The prices are reasonable. | tensor([ 8.4871, -2.3085, -2.0093, -2.6982, -0.4421, -1.3132, -1.7403, -0.8937])
It was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. | tensor([ 8.6248, -2.0478, -1.8572, -2.1769, -1.2127, -1.9662, -1.9719, -0.0546])
I really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart Pittsburgh. | tensor([ 8.7039, -2.0997, -1.8710, -2.4524, -0.6712, -1.9867, -2.0665, -0.4161])
It's truly a unique space. | tensor([ 8.5569, -2.5215, -2.1076, -2.5223, -0.2989, -1.3052, -1.9002, -0.7378])
I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.   | tensor([ 5.4536,  0.0438, -2.3062, -1.3608, -2.5868, -1.7918, -2.3367,  3.8187])
Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.   | tensor([ 7.7907,  0.0467, -3.1441, -2.5052, -1.0135, -2.1754, -2.4365,  1.2407])

On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes. | tensor([ 2.7861, -0.7950, -0.8252,  0.6614,  0.0451,  0.4318, -0.1641, -2.5896])

Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\n\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at. | tensor([ 7.1449, -1.9806, -2.5613, -1.8361,  1.3670, -1.0620, -0.8425, -2.2569])

As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. | tensor([ 5.4332,  0.1747, -3.1735,  0.6427, -0.1533, -1.7926, -2.1414, -0.4925])

This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \"garlicky\" on the menu. | tensor([ 8.1198, -2.6290, -2.0966, -1.8163,  0.1761, -1.6114, -1.5997, -1.1793])

And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\n\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. | tensor([ 8.5259, -1.9408, -2.4572, -2.4618, -0.2283, -2.5131, -1.5704, -0.3343])

 however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \"hippie-elitest\". | tensor([ 8.3507, -1.7658, -2.1884, -2.3822, -0.7665, -1.3878, -1.1269, -1.6145])

This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\n\nOn cold wintery days try a Mexican Hot Chocolate - it will surely warm your heart! | tensor([-0.5436, -2.8953,  2.0255, -1.2549, -1.3949,  6.2323, -1.5244, -1.0716])

Its hodge podge decor and hipster crowd are what drew me here in the first place, but turns out the food and coffee is pretty decent even delicious. | tensor([ 7.9111, -1.0916, -2.7018, -1.6715, -0.1432, -1.2556, -1.7733, -1.7798])

Maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- I don't know.\n\nThe 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. | tensor([-1.0308, -0.5475, -1.8127, -1.4542,  7.1232, -1.0705, -0.6773, -0.2905])

A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. | tensor([ 8.4192, -1.8954, -2.4144, -2.0734, -0.3540, -1.7956, -2.1149, -0.3975])

There's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes, teas and coffee drinks, and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries. | tensor([ 5.5549, -2.7825, -2.1845, -1.8284, -0.0909,  1.8787, -0.6296, -1.7403])

The kids didn't take long to leave, and now, years later, faced with a frankly less-than-appetizing Saturday menu, I find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone, too.\n\nQuiet Storm used to be a straight five star. | tensor([ 8.3087, -1.3177, -2.5635, -1.6565, -0.8797, -2.3196, -1.8187, -0.1484])
My last experience was honestly two-star, but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.\n\nI'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency, but they've come at expense to the clientele. | tensor([ 8.5943, -2.1668, -2.2786, -2.5099, -0.6020, -1.8845, -1.1953, -0.9522])

I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. | tensor([ 0.1882, -2.5651,  0.7431, -2.3876, -1.3692,  8.1100, -1.8119, -1.0857])
Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. | tensor([ 6.9101, -1.8784, -2.3813,  0.6996,  0.0655, -1.1933, -1.8877, -1.8033])
the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it. | tensor([ 0.9982, -1.4308,  1.6840, -2.6439, -1.2048,  6.0578, -2.2544, -1.0298])

Their menu is a limited on the weekdays, your best bet is one of their many quesadillas.\n\nI'm not as concerned about the preservation of vibe and atmosphere, as long as the food still tastes good. | tensor([ 7.9130, -2.1618, -2.3406, -1.4856, -0.8591, -0.7200, -1.5699, -1.5236])
I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.\n\nI wrote a review of Quiet Storm on my web site, Binge! | tensor([ 8.3758, -1.7929, -2.6846, -1.6754, -0.2939, -2.3827, -1.9427, -0.1634])

If I had any complaint it would be that I didn't see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it. | tensor([ 8.4941, -1.9310, -2.3563, -2.3758, -0.2241, -2.1260, -1.6065, -0.7598])

I'm not a big fan of it, so had I see that I would have asked for it without. | tensor([ 8.6667, -2.2881, -2.0138, -2.3969, -0.4212, -1.8921, -1.8278, -0.7254])

I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word \"seitan\" printed after every meat item on the menu. | tensor([ 7.9930, -1.9325, -2.3445, -1.9556, -1.5508, -1.3527, -1.5918,  0.1493])
Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. | tensor([ 6.5580,  1.6426, -3.2449, -1.3805,  0.6629, -2.2937, -1.6820, -1.5542])

If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.\n\nThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. | tensor([ 8.2712, -2.3935, -2.1980, -2.5074, -0.7511, -1.3193, -0.9724, -0.9978])
It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. | tensor([ 4.6842, -0.8970, -2.8697, -1.3028,  3.4367, -0.3386, -2.8676, -1.2273])

As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. | tensor([ 8.3419, -1.6287, -2.5976, -1.8201, -1.1462, -2.3722, -1.6715,  0.1378])
It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. | tensor([ 3.6935,  1.5242, -2.5180,  1.5644,  0.5480, -1.1567, -1.9348, -2.2822])
The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\n\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. | tensor([ 7.8973, -1.3243, -3.0819, -1.9313, -1.1419, -1.0309, -1.7382,  0.3155])

I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok, but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the \"mystery meat\" you get in your elementary school cafeteria. | tensor([ 1.2194,  4.0441, -2.7426,  1.1034,  0.5829, -0.6755, -1.5285, -0.6935])
My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.   | tensor([ 7.3580, -1.1110, -2.6296, -1.2897,  0.1980, -1.9862, -2.3866, -0.4914])

That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? | tensor([ 8.2686, -0.9920, -2.2564, -2.6942, -0.8000, -2.7073, -1.8533,  0.1889])

Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away. | tensor([ 8.1836, -2.0084, -1.5471, -0.7215, -2.1410, -2.1597, -1.3035, -0.9075])
 \n\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'   | tensor([ 8.6127, -2.2112, -2.3393, -2.3944, -0.3552, -2.1302, -1.1458, -1.0764])

My experience has been ok at the Quiet Storm because I have 1) not deviated much from my usual menu choice (Original Home Fries = delicious) and 2) I have often known several members of the wait staff at any given time.\n\nThis has given me reason to continue eating at Quiet Storm on occasion.\n\nNegatives... | tensor([ 8.1438, -1.8466, -2.5225, -1.6245, -1.2884, -1.7202, -1.8718,  0.1087])
I have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions, not enough seasonings, could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods, etc). | tensor([ 8.4583, -2.2723, -2.2046, -1.7039, -0.8804, -1.9103, -1.7213, -0.6516])

And I have been burned a few times when going out of my way (it is a little off the beaten path for many) to score some delicious Home Fries only to find that the QS had inexplicably closed early.\n\nDespite this, FOR PITTSBURGH, the QS is a good spot for vegan/vegetarian fare. | tensor([ 8.5263, -1.9146, -2.5626, -2.1900, -0.3185, -2.6349, -1.2472, -0.5711])
So when we first went here for brunch, I had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant. | tensor([ 8.1263, -1.6190, -2.3765, -1.1671, -1.3962, -2.6541, -1.6448, -0.1095])

That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.   | tensor([ 8.5480, -1.8397, -2.5294, -1.8031, -0.2883, -2.5719, -1.9267, -0.4857])

For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance. | tensor([ 8.2218, -1.8070, -2.2935, -1.4472, -0.7843, -1.9418, -1.1401, -1.6072])

she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).\n\nOne bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. | tensor([ 1.0109, -2.2507, -1.7232, -2.5071,  1.8274,  6.6418, -1.6586, -1.4042])
Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. | tensor([ 0.1490,  0.2476, -1.8658,  3.1656,  3.0520, -2.1776, -1.3589, -1.1865])
For a place that serves chili and \"cheez\" they may want to reconsider this open approach.\n\nThere are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. | tensor([ 8.3718, -1.8387, -2.5083, -2.1316, -0.1680, -1.8454, -1.6716, -1.1031])

My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a \"buttload\" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. | tensor([ 6.1901, -0.7507, -3.5619, -2.9829,  3.3738, -1.5208, -2.4500,  0.3388])
The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down. | tensor([ 8.3086, -2.2167, -2.3667, -1.0872, -0.8425, -2.3581, -1.7058, -0.5163])
I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. | tensor([ 7.7134, -0.0426, -2.7788, -1.6036, -0.7325, -2.2678, -0.5427, -1.9657])
Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster. | tensor([ 8.6091, -2.0629, -2.2299, -2.2144, -0.5016, -2.1624, -1.6045, -0.7585])

I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born. | tensor([-0.7573,  3.1964, -2.4399, -0.1622, -0.0255, -2.0193,  5.0152, -2.9160])
I don't know, I just get that impression. | tensor([ 8.6213, -2.0455, -2.2140, -2.6960, -0.2278, -1.7550, -2.0360, -0.4381])
\n\nI however feel a little weird for writing such a positive review on a uber crunchy place, so I feel the need to go slash tires on someone's Prius now. | tensor([ 8.5739, -1.6564, -2.4345, -1.9994, -0.5061, -2.1998, -1.7383, -0.8232])
Quiet Storm occupies a special place in my heart compartment because, one lazy Sunday in 2004, I discovered Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. | tensor([ 7.8604, -2.5464, -2.3708, -1.3660, -0.9750, -1.8535, -0.5711, -0.5715])
Imagine my joy: a cyberpunk fan, finding a tattered copy of some anonymous-looking book in some proto-hipster cafe (this was back before it was toooo hipster), and discovering the glories of Alfred Bester. | tensor([ 7.7536, -1.4932, -2.4746, -1.2919, -1.1367, -1.6170, -0.9494, -1.2777])

It also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of Pittsburgh in general, and the Hill District/Lawrenceville/Bloomfield in particular.\n\nAnyway. | tensor([ 5.1075, -2.2307, -3.1009, -4.1367,  1.5214,  2.7121,  0.0367, -1.5389])
I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. | tensor([ 8.4470, -2.1848, -1.8206, -2.3034, -0.9970, -1.4099, -1.8561, -0.7629])
I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). | tensor([ 7.6544, -2.4571, -2.3416, -1.2336, -0.8891, -1.3122, -1.1586, -0.7964])
Overall, it was fine. | tensor([ 8.6752, -2.0577, -2.1503, -2.5652, -0.5468, -1.4690, -2.0665, -0.4251])
I didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously, grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!), nor did I dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele, but shrug shrug. | tensor([ 6.4455,  0.6579, -3.4970, -1.9617,  0.3934, -1.2107,  0.0835, -2.3868])
They have these tofu tenders, which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing. | tensor([ 7.6061, -2.6023, -1.6881, -2.9286, -0.1771,  0.0963, -1.8256, -1.3099])

I can't put my finger on it, as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique, but holy crap, I can't get enough of them! | tensor([ 8.3549, -1.0058, -1.1716, -2.0347, -1.1693, -2.0807, -1.9438, -0.9948])

I had 3 orders in 2 days, and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... | tensor([ 8.5442, -2.3022, -2.1578, -2.3758, -0.5821, -2.1190, -0.9845, -1.1242])
it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.\nThe Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too. | tensor([ 8.1121, -1.9856, -2.0713, -1.5685, -1.1039, -0.7241, -1.8026, -1.1392])

\nThe slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt, and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other, half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome. | tensor([ 2.4664, -2.3931,  2.7787, -3.4206, -3.4783,  2.5080, -1.7622,  1.8467])
Despite my 3-star rating, I think I will be coming back here again to give it a second try.\n\nI got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli. | tensor([ 8.5819, -2.2298, -2.1504, -2.1786, -0.5032, -1.7879, -1.5288, -1.0744])

The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.   | tensor([ 2.7754, -1.7174, -0.3245, -0.8851, -2.1842,  4.8676, -2.7243,  0.3222])
However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out. | tensor([ 8.0340, -0.5439, -2.6989, -2.3927,  0.1128, -1.4885, -2.7595, -0.4040])

I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me. | tensor([ 8.2627, -2.0773, -2.1274, -2.3623, -0.2992, -1.1943, -2.4381, -0.2905])

I couldn't take another bite.\n\nHowever, my wife's apple panini was delicious. | tensor([ 0.7458, -0.7064, -2.3700, -2.2491,  8.3861, -1.4894, -2.4594,  0.6289])

The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.\n\nOn a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview. | tensor([ 5.2811, -1.9278, -2.2338, -0.5043, -1.9992, -0.9385, -1.1849,  1.3924])

Now they're making a reality show about it.\n\nIn the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me. | tensor([ 8.5116, -1.9244, -2.2246, -2.5263, -0.8778, -2.0906, -1.1574, -0.5521])

I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\n\nBut let me explain. | tensor([ 8.6723, -2.0594, -2.2072, -2.0191, -0.7389, -2.0747, -1.8714, -0.5241])

My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes. | tensor([ 8.4761, -1.9251, -1.9357, -2.2063, -0.8843, -1.4474, -2.3848, -0.2987])

However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.   | tensor([ 8.5664, -1.8901, -2.2290, -1.9916, -0.7261, -1.9243, -2.0692, -0.3250])
He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward. | tensor([ 8.6398, -2.1400, -2.1598, -2.1769, -0.3038, -2.1040, -2.1281, -0.4395])

There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us | tensor([ 8.4921, -1.9121, -2.4652, -2.6559,  0.2411, -2.1847, -2.0759, -0.2606])
but he had to \"look in the back\" to see if there was room. | tensor([ 6.3374, -2.2235, -1.1665, -2.2587, -1.8706, -0.0637, -1.1983,  0.1574])

One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves. | tensor([ 8.4719, -1.9128, -2.6632, -1.9276,  0.2644, -2.4425, -1.8805, -0.6384])

Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus. | tensor([ 8.4737, -2.4304, -2.1321, -1.8052, -0.3626, -2.5487, -1.1976, -0.9927])

I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice. | tensor([ 7.1927, -1.1589, -3.1023, -1.4261,  2.2473, -2.1995, -2.0245, -1.5399])

But of course, our food came and mine was cold.   | tensor([ 8.4014, -2.0121, -2.0740, -3.1563, -0.0842, -1.3061, -2.0283, -0.7169])
The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread. | tensor([ 6.4960, -0.0648, -0.6928, -1.4217, -1.2693, -2.5857, -2.5277, -0.0239])

Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served. | tensor([ 7.9338, -2.1333, -1.8406, -1.9835, -0.6742, -1.5452, -1.9925, -0.4615])

I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives. | tensor([ 7.9378, -0.9234, -2.2043, -1.3946, -0.9608, -2.2602, -0.5377, -1.8536])

Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place. | tensor([ 8.5352, -1.9935, -1.8330, -1.9744, -0.7994, -2.3210, -1.8129, -0.5342])
I came into Quiet Storm not intending to have lunch, but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while (working from home makes me stir crazy, so bouncing around local coffeehouses, completely NOT fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes). | tensor([ 8.2554, -0.9738, -3.0403, -1.2358, -1.0429, -2.4444, -1.8163,  0.0250])
\n\nI walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there, but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table, because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. | tensor([ 3.9692,  2.1949, -3.6866, -0.3028,  1.2193, -2.1396,  1.5552, -3.5040])
I didn't need to, but  ... good lookin' out. | tensor([ 8.1723, -2.3600, -2.0645, -3.1523,  0.0935, -0.1793, -2.4187, -0.7395])
\n\nAnyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. | tensor([ 8.4621, -2.4023, -2.6021, -2.2552, -0.2513, -1.4966, -1.1747, -1.0508])

That's fine. \n\nMenu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. | tensor([ 7.8572, -1.9259, -1.9511, -2.3094, -0.0167, -1.0683, -1.9283, -0.8745])
They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie | tensor([ 4.2469,  3.5881, -3.3516, -1.4735,  0.9239, -2.3896,  0.0178, -2.2601])
I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. | tensor([ 8.4254, -2.2486, -2.5446, -2.5427,  0.5189, -1.8349, -1.9638, -0.6919])
I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. | tensor([ 8.2035, -1.5919, -3.1553, -2.3027,  1.5528, -2.4089, -1.9867, -0.6826])
My fault for not speaking up. | tensor([ 8.5752, -2.2049, -2.3199, -2.4195, -0.2880, -2.3126, -1.6910, -0.2431])
Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8. | tensor([ 7.5785,  0.5057, -2.6499, -2.3041, -0.6287, -1.9427, -2.7517,  0.2670])
\n\nI'll finish with this: Internets are free, right? | tensor([ 7.3960, -1.4783, -2.5978,  0.3411, -0.9832, -2.6418, -1.7939, -0.7947])

Did I need to ask??\nI'll definitely go back though, intrigued by a few other things on the menu (like bbq tenders and pulled 'pork' quesadilla), and hopefully be a little more impressed. | tensor([ 8.4434, -2.0616, -2.6674, -2.6822,  0.3730, -1.3981, -1.8012, -0.9861])

All were a large portion with excellent fresh ingredients at a price that was really really great. | tensor([ 8.5043, -2.2622, -1.9705, -2.5715, -0.4520, -1.3635, -1.8194, -0.8826])
 \n\nMy significant other is addicted to the chili, which actually has a good heat level. | tensor([ 8.4740, -2.1867, -2.3223, -2.5022, -0.3234, -1.6694, -1.9227, -0.5283])

This is the perfect casual restaurant. | tensor([ 8.3749, -2.2144, -2.2256, -2.7297,  0.0604, -1.4310, -2.3130, -0.3536])

The decor is funky  and cool. | tensor([ 8.1858, -2.3293, -2.1599, -2.4863,  0.4086, -0.5176, -2.3814, -1.2967])

There is even a pinball machine!\n\nWill return again and again I am sure. | tensor([ 8.1666, -2.3133, -0.8045, -1.6386, -1.5544, -1.3134, -2.1692, -0.7372])
So I admit my boyfriend | tensor([ 8.5622, -2.2699, -2.3696, -2.8735,  0.5850, -2.1627, -1.7806, -0.5745])
and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.\n \nWe went this past weekend and had brunch. | tensor([ 7.8782, -2.4717, -1.9255, -1.2555, -0.8373, -1.3466, -1.7208, -1.1467])
We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. | tensor([ 0.3670, -3.3317,  2.7492, -1.7420, -1.6670,  5.6926, -2.0545, -0.7518])
He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.\n\nHis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay... | tensor([ 0.8552, -0.8171, -2.5868,  7.3511,  0.1721, -1.3582, -2.6123, -1.1668])
but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). | tensor([ 8.4971, -1.3949, -2.5465, -2.4802, -0.3126, -1.8768, -1.8443, -0.6292])
I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.\n\nI am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had. | tensor([ 4.5041, -1.0758, -2.9593,  5.0469, -0.5943, -2.2356, -2.1546, -1.6819])
 \n\nI will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back. | tensor([ 8.2826, -1.3060, -2.4244, -2.4035, -0.0963, -1.6732, -2.1829, -0.6423])
I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. | tensor([ 8.0019, -2.6220, -1.6247, -2.2833, -0.6880, -0.5747, -1.3930, -1.5847])
My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. | tensor([ 4.8808, -3.0100,  1.5199, -2.1489, -1.4267,  2.4438, -1.3294, -2.6519])
I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. | tensor([ 8.1908, -1.5036, -1.9018, -1.7447, -0.8277, -1.7487, -2.1201, -0.8494])
But honestly... | tensor([ 8.4034, -2.2226, -2.1808, -3.0360, -0.1027, -1.2352, -2.0468, -0.4264])
It tasted like nothing. | tensor([ 8.5232, -2.0951, -2.1888, -2.5514, -0.1772, -1.8652, -2.0382, -0.2650])
I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. | tensor([ 2.3477, -2.4495,  1.5521, -3.0695, -2.4099,  5.8434, -1.7340, -0.5132])
Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... | tensor([ 8.0072, -1.8898, -1.4907, -2.5557, -1.5608,  0.2296, -2.4947, -0.8390])
But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. | tensor([ 8.4802, -1.7283, -2.5444, -2.7904,  0.1647, -1.7937, -1.4634, -1.2967])

        -9.7793e-01, -3.3615e+00, -3.3001e-01])
We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. | tensor([-0.4584, -0.5497,  1.2629, -1.5741, -0.9887,  1.5416, -0.6909,  0.2668])
On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. | tensor([ 8.6269, -2.1259, -2.0710, -2.5408, -0.5953, -1.9858, -1.9896, -0.2410])
I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. | tensor([ 6.7350, -1.4940, -1.6754, -0.6796, -0.2349, -2.6528, -2.3103,  0.0353])
Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. | tensor([ 8.1196, -2.6548, -2.0844, -0.6246, -1.0724, -1.9084, -1.3984, -1.1325])
We had to tell someone else to get it for us. | tensor([ 8.5136, -2.0698, -2.2544, -2.7740, -0.0712, -1.9436, -1.8965, -0.3311])
Also they don't really wash their cups. | tensor([ 5.4187, -1.5469, -0.9648,  0.3046, -1.8837, -0.4633, -1.5254, -0.7049])
There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. | tensor([-1.6657,  0.7044, -1.5861,  3.0651,  0.8082, -2.7927, -0.9966,  3.1694])
It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. | tensor([ 8.5293e+00, -1.6413e+00, -2.1365e+00, -2.0503e+00, -6.3949e-01,

Good idea, but poorly executed food. | tensor([ 8.4222, -2.5737, -1.7228, -2.4962, -0.9139, -1.5132, -1.2941, -1.0272])
I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. | tensor([ 7.0304, -1.7448, -2.4983, -1.7932, -0.2305, -0.9149, -1.9393, -0.1768])
For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. | tensor([ 3.3691, -2.1874, -1.0181,  2.6956, -3.0689, -0.9427,  1.1317, -1.7770])
This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... | tensor([ 8.6586, -2.1510, -1.8871, -2.5711, -0.8262, -1.9924, -1.4737, -0.5810])
Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price. | tensor([ 8.4764, -2.2047, -1.7533, -2.6471, -0.9226, -1.5482, -2.2070, -0.0788])
My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad service we were receiving. | tensor([ 8.2057, -1.9751, -1.6320, -3.0302, -1.1191, -1.7370, -2.3279,  0.5590])
We used to call the servers \"Whole Foods Rejects\"; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed, rushed. | tensor([ 2.0639,  1.7943, -2.5383,  4.0611, -1.9420, -3.0744, -1.3922,  0.9249])
At the end of 2011, I think they got a new manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. | tensor([ 8.6866, -2.1290, -2.0139, -2.3930, -0.6663, -2.4523, -1.3076, -0.7036])
Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee. | tensor([ 8.3651, -2.5194, -1.0913, -2.8450, -0.6471, -0.4844, -2.0581, -1.4444])
Worst tofu scramble ever. | tensor([ 8.4967, -2.1333, -2.2110, -1.9623, -0.4471, -2.1114, -1.5953, -0.8309])

Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. | tensor([ 8.5150, -2.1007, -2.4355, -2.6476,  0.4260, -2.2664, -1.6354, -0.7070])
I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \"chef\" thought it appropriate to serve. | tensor([ 8.4874, -2.3904, -2.4880, -1.8432,  0.2782, -2.5362, -1.3569, -0.9711])
\n\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one. | tensor([ 8.2897, -0.7448, -2.9216, -1.8078, -0.3117, -2.5223, -2.0814, -0.3861])

Servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences. | tensor([ 8.3134, -2.0391, -2.6469, -1.3302, -0.3190, -2.6851, -1.6234, -0.4821])
The food is really pretty good, but if the overall service sucks, then well, it makes it hard to enjoy a tasty meal. | tensor([ 8.2961, -2.1111, -1.9177, -1.6145, -1.3294, -2.4678, -0.8857, -0.8306])

Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. | tensor([ 8.6810, -2.3157, -1.7516, -2.0062, -1.1549, -1.7737, -1.9085, -0.6830])
If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu. | tensor([ 8.4725, -1.9993, -2.0704, -2.2485, -0.6214, -1.7284, -2.0573, -0.7555])
Me and my kids got food togo from here, because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.\n\nCute and attractive DIY style decor.\nFriendly staff.\n\nI really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars). | tensor([ 8.3662, -1.7532, -2.5148, -1.8818, -0.5288, -2.0513, -1.6612, -0.7993])
 GOt a tofu banh mi with a side salad. | tensor([ 8.4268, -2.6046, -2.2284, -2.0339,  0.1477, -1.8200, -1.4352, -1.4339])

When I asked what dressing they had, I expected to hear the list of \"usual\" uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have. | tensor([ 7.7268, -1.7402, -2.7552, -1.2795,  0.0731, -2.1466, -1.5995, -0.9876])

The first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.\n\nMy kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).\n\nAnyhoo. | tensor([ 6.7821,  0.7363, -2.6542, -2.2126, -0.2366, -1.4454, -2.2625, -0.3059])

 \n\nAs with any place I review, I am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.   | tensor([ 8.2572, -2.6466, -1.6043, -2.1494, -1.2265, -1.5576, -0.7008, -1.3455])
Anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me. | tensor([ 8.1614, -1.3963, -2.7066, -2.6916,  0.1774, -1.8688, -2.2641, -0.1611])

I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. | tensor([ 8.2859, -2.0011, -2.0676, -2.3959, -0.5595, -1.6801, -1.9559, -0.5799])

I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. | tensor([ 2.2661, -1.9110,  0.4681, -1.3844, -0.3977,  3.2030, -3.2250,  0.9267])

It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. | tensor([ 7.4014,  0.0600, -3.3094, -1.7214, -1.1855, -0.4391, -1.9198, -0.2027])
The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! | tensor([ 3.0422,  0.7930, -2.4804, -0.9811, -2.2275,  4.5510, -0.8409, -2.0568])
Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! | tensor([ 7.9376, -1.8035, -2.4128, -0.1373, -1.2562, -2.9976, -2.1884,  0.4432])

I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike! | tensor([ 8.4077, -1.9921, -2.2393, -1.8978, -0.6069, -2.2098, -1.6459, -0.7788])
The Quiet Storm was great. | tensor([ 8.4140, -1.6304, -2.2439, -2.8335, -0.9112, -1.8709, -2.0619,  0.4958])
I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. | tensor([ 8.5270, -1.7771, -2.2763, -2.4667, -0.5457, -1.8551, -1.8740, -0.4220])
It had an unexpected texture | tensor([ 8.4346, -2.3406, -2.0786, -2.2768, -0.4727, -0.9134, -1.7477, -1.1638])
but I still quite enjoyed it. | tensor([ 8.4763, -1.8522, -2.2219, -2.5248, -0.5390, -1.4813, -2.3757, -0.1930])
For my entr\u00e9e I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. | tensor([ 7.8054, -0.1988, -2.7304, -2.1488, -0.1606, -1.5391, -2.8240, -0.2166])
It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. | tensor([ 8.3638, -1.9788, -1.9304, -2.3813, -0.2710, -1.1150, -2.5221, -0.6279])
I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! | tensor([-0.1475,  0.5393, -2.2781,  7.9667, -0.3198, -1.4929, -1.5373, -2.0545])
Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead | tensor([ 3.0725,  2.9531, -2.6465, -0.1864,  1.2373, -3.4670, -3.3236,  2.8242])
so I got a latte, which was also very good. | tensor([ 7.8022, -1.6086, -2.8870, -2.2698,  0.8604, -1.2362, -2.8086, -0.4936])
One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. | tensor([ 8.4216, -2.1268, -2.4060, -2.4156, -0.1217, -1.6708, -2.1014, -0.3623])
I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!\n\nI was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu, so I will need to go back to try more. | tensor([ 8.6547, -2.0067, -2.2838, -2.0707, -0.4205, -1.5535, -2.1650, -0.8078])

She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. \n\nNice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. | tensor([ 0.0397, -0.1091, -2.5411,  7.5004,  0.9154, -1.6711, -2.3294, -1.6163])
If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown, but to my eyes it was fine. | tensor([ 8.3581, -1.4047, -2.4297, -2.1222, -1.2563, -1.9007, -2.2478,  0.4850])

hangout.\n\nThe aunt-in-law is a meateater and in her seventies, but she really enjoyed her tempeh Cubano. | tensor([ 6.9484, -1.7714, -1.6808, -3.1866, -0.4163,  1.0110, -2.3780, -0.5805])

No room for dessert though.\n\nI got the Banh Mi | tensor([ 3.4919, -3.9069,  2.2967, -3.2197, -1.5339,  2.3526, -1.7286,  0.6032])

Nuff said.\n\nThe service was in my mind delightful. | tensor([ 8.3950, -2.5470, -1.6412, -2.0625, -0.5943, -1.9512, -1.6425, -0.9731])
The server was engaging and welcoming to my somewhat timorous companion, explaining the dishes to her and making a recommendation that worked out. | tensor([ 6.1025,  0.1669, -2.9693, -0.7717,  2.1216, -1.5456, -2.6883, -1.7558])
He was efficient and personable.\n\nToo bad I won't be back in Pittsburgh anytime soon, or I would make a repeat visit for sure. | tensor([ 8.4705, -2.2365, -2.2157, -2.2129, -1.1006, -0.9060, -1.7352, -0.6843])
Andrew here said it best: \"...  food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily.\"\n\nIt took me 40 minutes to get a sandwich here, and when I complained I didn't get an apology, just a snarky remark \"well you can see we have a small kitchen\" | tensor([ 8.3238, -1.5247, -2.7409, -1.4524, -0.3933, -3.1220, -1.0341, -0.4563])
I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. | tensor([ 8.5167, -2.3351, -1.8364, -1.9750, -0.7472, -2.4206, -1.6154, -0.5810])
It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. | tensor([ 6.7423, -1.4808, -1.4809, -0.1113, -1.5076, -1.7741, -1.2448, -1.0318])
Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\n\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. | tensor([ 7.9860, -2.0845, -2.6929,  0.1567, -0.8355, -2.3674, -1.6955, -0.6439])

Yep, that description of their \"chorizo\" comes directly off their menu. | tensor([ 8.2807, -1.9950, -2.0126, -2.4066, -0.8111, -0.5415, -1.8531, -1.1949])
Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \"foods.\"\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. | tensor([-2.0794,  0.3430,  0.2375,  2.5163,  0.2974, -0.2603, -0.4456, -0.6547])
I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. | tensor([ 8.2262, -1.4869, -2.1810, -1.7737, -0.7543, -1.7629, -2.1712, -0.8391])

How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. | tensor([ 1.8817, -0.1291, -2.3498,  5.9668,  0.2933, -1.4071, -2.5505, -1.7239])

Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \"Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\"? | tensor([ 6.1899,  0.7933, -2.7516,  0.4657, -0.5948, -2.8132, -2.3090, -0.4563])

I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting. | tensor([ 8.4199, -1.9282, -2.3823, -1.2432, -1.1153, -2.5111, -1.4770, -0.5830])

We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time. | tensor([ 5.4152, -0.7487, -0.7478,  0.7380, -2.1313, -1.3319, -1.7990, -0.6847])

I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning. | tensor([-0.7775, -2.2586,  0.2555, -2.3705, -0.2366,  6.1545, -1.6037,  1.3393])

I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). | tensor([ 4.3662,  0.5062, -2.9479,  3.7235, -0.5790, -2.3843, -1.6803, -1.8593])

I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). | tensor([ 5.3691, -1.0663, -2.6319,  0.0933,  1.2536,  0.6949, -3.3189, -1.5100])
Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. | tensor([ 8.1778, -2.2518, -1.9531, -2.3159, -0.7870, -0.7220, -2.0583, -0.8515])
We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \"seisage\", cheese, etc.) was very good. | tensor([ 0.6995, -1.4145, -1.8507,  0.1420,  0.2160,  5.0607, -1.8625, -1.0689])
Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. | tensor([ 7.0187, -2.6536, -0.4226, -1.6841, -2.5161,  0.8212, -2.6702,  0.0730])
We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!\n\nSome complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the \"slow food movement.\" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.\n\nSo, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. | tensor([ 8.2476, -1.7266, -2.6186, -1.2195, -0.8911, -2.1256, -0.9850, -1.1283])
Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. | tensor([ 7.9935, -1.5380, -2.1839, -2.2007, -1.6655, -0.0422, -2.3391,  0.0931])
The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. | tensor([ 6.3740, -0.9747, -2.2062, -2.0412, -2.7402, -0.8302, -2.0035,  2.8778])
I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! | tensor([ 3.4467, -0.4669, -1.8235, -3.3060, -2.7679,  5.4030, -1.5189,  0.2504])
\n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often | tensor([ 8.3324, -1.5259, -1.7625, -2.3603, -1.1738, -1.9728, -2.7480,  0.6411])

I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. | tensor([ 8.4636, -1.5656, -2.3539, -2.5418, -0.8883, -1.8384, -1.8809, -0.0334])
The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. | tensor([ 7.5808, -2.9103,  0.7663, -2.3012, -1.8996, -1.7745, -1.6678, -0.8040])
It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. | tensor([ 0.0896, -0.5847, -1.7572,  7.9784, -0.4325, -1.4523, -2.2327, -1.4265])
The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. | tensor([ 7.6979e+00, -2.4370e+00, -1.4476e+00, -3.0155e+00, -8.0023e-01,

The vegan \"cheese\" sauce was also rich and delicious.   | tensor([ 7.6871, -1.4688, -2.6031, -2.1872,  0.0207, -1.5055, -2.3048, -0.4880])
The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. | tensor([ 8.5885, -1.8678, -2.1911, -2.6792, -0.7596, -1.9113, -1.7668, -0.0922])
Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. | tensor([ 7.7104, -1.5807, -2.5780, -1.6237, -1.0599, -2.7535, -0.9702,  0.1693])
I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. | tensor([-0.3860, -0.5486, -1.8052,  7.9824, -0.2026, -1.1927, -2.3323, -1.2192])
\n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. | tensor([ 8.6328, -2.1858, -1.9096, -2.3185, -0.7052, -1.8890, -1.8951, -0.5996])
A group of my friends came here for Brunch. | tensor([ 8.6328, -1.8460, -2.0452, -2.3053, -0.9474, -2.0328, -1.8639, -0.4245])
Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. | tensor([ 2.4685, -2.2225, -1.1895,  0.5569, -1.4607, -0.7192,  3.5549, -2.8285])
Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. | tensor([ 8.0997, -2.3979, -2.4050, -2.2738, -0.4400, -1.0936, -1.3177, -0.8550])
They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. | tensor([ 8.4296, -2.3260, -1.9536, -2.4221, -0.6230, -1.8787, -1.5075, -0.6000])
All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. | tensor([ 8.0480, -1.1585, -2.5597, -1.1069, -1.0555, -2.3183, -1.5075, -1.0752])

It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. | tensor([ 6.8681,  0.0284, -2.3111, -0.2187, -1.7685, -1.2862, -2.7340, -0.4891])
Food comes as quickly as possible. | tensor([ 7.3974, -2.6048,  0.0686, -2.5494, -1.9488, -0.1728, -1.8827, -0.9021])
There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. | tensor([-0.5705, -0.3501, -1.7565,  8.3442, -0.2906, -1.8378, -1.7110, -1.4569])
(Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) | tensor([ 4.5208, -0.5420, -2.3604,  3.6977, -2.5719, -2.0803, -1.8072, -0.2277])
\n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. | tensor([ 8.2038, -1.7495, -2.5738, -1.8307, -0.4289, -1.7393, -2.1579, -0.3754])
\n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water. | tensor([ 8.0517, -1.5173, -2.3068, -0.7813, -1.3125, -2.7847, -0.4267, -1.4578])
My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. | tensor([-0.5735, -0.1122, -0.9482, -2.0658, -1.9652,  1.5821, -0.0406,  4.8606])
We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!\n\nWe weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless, the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. | tensor([ 8.5906, -1.7768, -2.4214, -2.2628, -0.8332, -1.9340, -1.7796, -0.4397])
Friend ordered the Nyam, which she said was very filling (surprisingly). | tensor([ 5.4785, -2.4884, -0.6208, -3.1463,  1.0393,  1.3651, -2.5093, -0.3306])
I had the the Country burrito, which definitely surpassed my expectations. | tensor([ 5.1847, -1.4381, -2.0821, -2.0140,  1.3811, -0.2163, -3.3144,  1.2762])
Decent, good. \n\nFriend & I both ordered the Don Juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! | tensor([ 8.2435, -1.6007, -2.5654, -2.8996, -0.8676, -1.6527, -1.6352,  0.3176])
AMAZINGLY GOOD- | tensor([ 7.9928, -2.5085, -2.1165, -2.6547,  0.2638, -0.7344, -1.6549, -1.4287])
I always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. | tensor([ 8.4402, -1.8968, -2.3090, -2.6187,  0.0496, -1.6696, -1.9736, -0.4559])
I'm only sad that I can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. | tensor([ 8.1046, -2.3417,  0.0151, -2.3751, -2.5316, -1.0307, -2.0016, -0.6408])
\n\nMight not necessarily go out of my way to come back | tensor([ 8.6413, -2.4068, -1.9825, -2.3994, -0.5287, -1.6459, -1.6826, -0.8668])
BUT I would definitely go again if I were in the area. | tensor([ 8.5274, -2.2917, -2.2332, -3.0248, -0.1515, -1.3545, -1.7916, -0.5049])

Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\n \n1. | tensor([ 8.6292, -2.1523, -2.2124, -2.2590, -0.4165, -1.9882, -1.5301, -1.0801])
The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. | tensor([ 8.4577, -2.5612, -1.8204, -2.6118, -0.6437, -2.0780, -0.1001, -1.7240])
All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\u00f6rhead tank top. | tensor([ 3.4762,  0.7096, -2.7648, -2.2884,  4.5111, -0.2801, -1.4256, -1.7563])
I am a huge Mot\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\n \n2. | tensor([ 8.6346, -1.8017, -2.3743, -2.1299, -0.3578, -2.3130, -1.8465, -0.6032])
The food is bland. | tensor([ 8.4185, -2.5852, -0.9821, -2.3735, -1.1410, -1.5173, -1.5870, -1.3206])
Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\n \n3. | tensor([ 4.9874, -2.4494, -1.6848, -1.8122, -1.4597,  3.5367, -0.3315, -1.9586])
The service was pretty bad. | tensor([ 8.6816, -2.1170, -1.8913, -2.7719, -0.7172, -2.0650, -1.6917, -0.4174])
Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. | tensor([ 8.0074, -2.0325, -2.5280, -2.3041,  0.2003, -1.6731, -0.2520, -2.0502])
I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. | tensor([ 8.3629, -2.3173, -2.3239, -2.5215,  0.6637, -2.1048, -1.2215, -1.3379])
Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. | tensor([ 8.4622, -1.6451, -2.1830, -2.1181, -1.2266, -2.4530, -1.5894,  0.2085])
The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. | tensor([ 1.4541,  0.3994, -2.7794,  0.6636,  4.4798, -1.0126, -1.0539, -2.1946])
I think Pittsburgh deserves better. | tensor([ 8.5743, -2.1062, -1.9791, -2.6613, -0.6004, -1.7505, -1.9910, -0.4113])
Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. | tensor([ 8.6131, -1.6136, -2.4478, -2.1440, -0.5332, -2.1918, -1.8503, -0.7023])
Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. | tensor([ 8.3427, -2.5000, -1.3828, -2.7648, -1.0546, -1.3991, -0.9443, -1.3538])
Excellent coffee too. | tensor([ 8.4906, -2.1096, -2.3573, -2.6056,  0.2922, -1.7164, -2.2290, -0.6677])
This place is great! | tensor([ 8.4027, -1.6323, -1.9140, -2.2333, -0.5855, -1.6641, -2.8192, -0.1146])

We had the horchata was didn't taste exactly like horchata but was delicious. | tensor([ 8.3742, -2.0313, -2.5076, -2.5889,  0.3107, -1.8306, -2.0033, -0.5183])
We ordered the bah mi which came with two types of fake meat on it. | tensor([ 7.8983, -1.8251, -1.7429, -2.7219, -0.5083, -0.6070, -2.1566, -0.8848])
It wasn't a traditional tasting bah mi as it didn't have enough jalepanos, cilantro and it was much heavier | tensor([ 2.4307, -2.9658,  1.0699, -2.4173, -0.4178,  4.7439, -2.0987, -0.6727])
but the bread was good and all in all it was a delicious sandwich. | tensor([ 7.7626, -2.1658,  0.1115, -2.0400, -1.1480, -1.6211, -2.5522, -1.1682])
We also had the flower salad which comes with a heavy dose of kale and smoked tempeh. | tensor([ 4.7901, -3.6210,  1.7529, -1.9000, -1.9292,  0.7786, -2.2888,  0.4262])

it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese. | tensor([ 7.3725, -0.3748, -2.6595, -2.0420, -0.9703, -1.8463, -2.3108,  0.6759])

In the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza, pushed out the door, only to walk across the street, eat mediocre pizza, and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away. | tensor([ 8.6027, -2.1915, -2.1498, -2.1093, -0.7408, -2.5736, -1.3317, -0.4970])

As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. | tensor([ 4.3174, -1.9240, -1.3964, -3.2200, -0.0304,  3.9763, -2.3561, -0.3322])
Probably not ordering from here again. | tensor([ 8.6028, -2.4405, -2.1652, -2.6319, -0.2077, -1.9452, -1.2756, -1.1287])
I moved to PGH about 3 years ago with my cat and was nervous about finding a new vet. | tensor([ 8.3106, -1.1797, -2.4717, -1.7572, -0.9356, -2.6575, -2.2230,  0.3456])
My previous vet in NY was just wonderful | tensor([ 7.6406, -0.8950, -2.1829, -2.0876, -1.2389, -2.6483, -2.7568,  1.8382])
and I was doubtful that I would find another as good or as caring as her. | tensor([ 7.7131, -1.7859, -2.7587, -3.2056,  2.2131, -1.7380, -2.3464, -0.4671])
Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. | tensor([ 8.6184, -2.0273, -1.9935, -2.2226, -0.7437, -2.0069, -1.8933, -0.6487])
Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there, and I try to get her as often as I can, but I have also seen Dr. Berger who is great and have heard good things about Dr. Schroth as well. | tensor([ 8.3415, -2.1829, -2.2185, -1.1754, -0.7146, -2.1415, -2.0507, -0.4468])
Dr. Gerson is the owner, I have seen him once and he is a tad gruff, but if you are direct with him he is easy to work with. | tensor([ 8.3781, -1.6702, -2.3579, -1.3472, -1.0043, -1.9055, -2.1425, -0.4307])
\nMy cat has always had a bit of a weight issue and since going to Point Breeze and working with Dr. Simard my cat has gone from 25 lbs to 18lbs and we seem to be well on the way to Dr. Simards goal of 16lbs. | tensor([ 8.4917, -1.2240, -2.5200, -1.8203, -0.7987, -2.4984, -1.9010, -0.4118])
\nMy cat was also treated by Dr. Simard for a bad case of worms, after apparently catching and consuming a mouse in our basement - again they got me in right away and before I knew it he was worm-free. | tensor([ 8.3333, -2.1151, -2.2035, -1.1026, -0.7573, -2.4288, -1.6159, -0.7542])
\nI have never felt like they wanted to up-sell me on anything, and they have always been very patient and willing to hear my concerns. | tensor([ 8.4851, -2.2623, -1.5307, -2.1770, -1.2512, -1.5525, -1.4085, -1.2212])

The facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal.\n\nI was particularly impressed when I had my cat declawed. | tensor([ 8.5202, -1.7870, -2.4054, -2.3283, -0.7077, -1.8697, -1.6843, -0.5907])
They kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress.\n\nIt seems a bit expensive (although I have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it. | tensor([ 8.5479, -1.4430, -2.4451, -2.5348, -0.4361, -2.2461, -1.9504, -0.2168])
The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. | tensor([ 8.2597, -1.8143, -2.4896, -1.7956, -0.6677, -2.2488, -2.1257, -0.0139])
She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. | tensor([ 8.4818, -1.9364, -2.8782, -2.6603,  0.7939, -2.1440, -1.8320, -0.3937])
She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. | tensor([ 7.7329, -1.5485, -2.8666, -0.4186,  0.4922, -2.7491, -2.5572, -0.3605])
She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. | tensor([ 7.9489, -2.2344, -2.4295, -2.6163,  0.5803, -2.0418, -1.2731, -0.4298])
After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. | tensor([ 8.5740, -2.3316, -2.3303, -2.1984,  0.0478, -2.5583, -1.2374, -0.8350])
\n\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. | tensor([ 8.5113, -2.0765, -2.3676, -1.8735, -0.5963, -2.1244, -1.5785, -0.5470])
She seemed tired, and overworked.\n\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. | tensor([ 8.3050, -2.1709, -3.0140, -2.1699,  0.5003, -1.7059, -1.1257, -1.2391])

See, as Julina below says, it's close to Frick Park and it's a wonderful place to pick up sandwiches, pop, or picnic supplies before going over there. | tensor([ 8.3721, -1.7581, -2.5917, -2.0915, -0.5269, -2.0681, -1.8576,  0.0135])

It's also a great place to sit outside with a cup of coffee or a cold drink or snack before going over to the Frick Mansion.   | tensor([ 8.4174, -1.8011, -2.1068, -1.6801, -1.3773, -2.3249, -1.5148, -0.1871])
So you can stop here with your out-of-town guests while sightseeing.\n\nThis is truly a little out-of-the-way gem, located on a side street. | tensor([ 8.2377, -1.9633, -2.3479, -2.7401, -0.3883, -0.9318, -1.4878, -1.1112])

Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. | tensor([ 7.5195, -1.7169, -2.8397, -1.8317,  0.8447, -1.2828, -2.7148, -0.5815])
The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\n\nThe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. | tensor([ 0.5048,  3.1483, -1.5621, -1.7914, -2.0565, -1.3786, -0.2417,  4.5529])

\n\nI like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection. | tensor([-0.7559, -3.7819,  5.3080, -0.6794, -1.8028,  2.0089, -0.6052, -1.4512])

The java jolt smoothie is amazing, as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!\n\nIf you can judge a town by its co-op, which I am prone to do, Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper. | tensor([ 8.1767, -1.1775, -2.4001, -2.2241, -1.1359, -2.1121, -2.3985,  0.7818])

I would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished, as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.\n\nFor my future needs, I will be ordering directly from the farm (this co-op sells items from the farm that I will be direct ordering from) at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere. | tensor([ 8.3016, -1.4909, -2.3434, -3.0451, -0.1971, -1.4417, -1.5869, -1.0912])

Very primitive bouldering area, but the routes were challenging, in part due to the lack of a smearable surface (plywood kinda painted to look like rocks),  mega shitty footholds (jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing), and a distinct lack of fall-friendliness (one old mat to be shared among every 3 or 4 walls, and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it). | tensor([ 8.3273, -0.7850, -2.6514, -2.3919, -0.9241, -2.0353, -1.6875, -0.3490])
 Not a bargain for a $12 day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent. | tensor([ 8.6762, -1.7137, -2.2347, -2.0843, -0.8329, -1.9690, -1.7043, -0.8920])
The changing room was literally a closet.\n\nAll that griping aside, there were some decent climbs. | tensor([ 8.2771, -0.8505, -2.8031, -2.1992, -0.5014, -2.3110, -2.0378, -0.1845])

Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. | tensor([ 8.4084, -1.6560, -2.2381, -1.4333, -1.2194, -2.6228, -2.2551,  0.2403])

Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls, but I was pretty impressed by this location (though note, this review is just for bouldering). | tensor([ 5.7000,  0.4542, -2.0212, -1.9790, -1.3949, -2.9977, -3.1209,  3.7529])
The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. | tensor([ 8.3993, -1.0479, -2.3224, -2.0997, -1.2044, -2.6513, -2.1158,  0.4204])

although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.\n\nThe routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. | tensor([ 8.5102, -1.4115, -2.5885, -1.6900, -0.7757, -2.6476, -1.7229, -0.3788])

Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. | tensor([ 1.5170,  1.0524, -3.0757, -0.4789,  2.4053, -2.1366, -1.6691,  1.9399])

The last climb I went out was a real one in Utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up . | tensor([ 7.9968, -1.0128, -1.1301, -2.7151, -1.5892, -2.2443, -2.4320,  0.9354])
You can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lol.\n\nSo for a beginner I found the price to be ok I went with a group and paid 16$ for shoe rental and I guess climbing fee? | tensor([ 8.6548, -1.6839, -2.0917, -2.4665, -0.7756, -2.2747, -1.8736, -0.3317])
We stayed for about two hours. | tensor([ 8.3918, -2.0655, -1.4223, -2.8837, -1.0350, -1.5197, -2.1401,  0.0688])
We went on a Saturday it was very crowded probably 15-30 people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall. | tensor([ 7.7077, -1.5477, -0.7249, -2.3727, -1.8367, -2.4302, -2.5933,  1.1965])
There were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength. | tensor([ 8.0127, -1.1803, -2.8075, -0.6500, -0.8267, -2.6888, -2.5770,  0.4974])
Then some V2 and V3 and V4, the other beginner gals I was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the VB to V2 on some of the climbs. | tensor([ 4.9841,  0.1638, -3.6326, -1.7479,  4.0474, -2.6295, -2.3656,  0.2632])
So sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if you're a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering. | tensor([ 7.2336,  0.9344, -3.1917, -1.8354, -0.8126, -2.8792, -2.0720,  1.0053])
\n\nI think safety-wise things are bit of a liability here, walls are high, mats are very old and very few. | tensor([ 8.0723, -1.0307, -2.0428, -2.3953, -0.9418, -1.4522, -1.8578, -0.8060])
Also lots of people don't follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone. | tensor([ 5.9035,  2.1085, -2.4582, -1.5685, -2.0596, -2.9872, -2.5389,  2.8597])
So be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty. | tensor([ 8.7038, -1.8207, -2.2195, -2.3320, -0.3558, -2.5220, -1.7804, -0.5055])
\n\nI also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos, but I understand that this is Pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west. | tensor([ 8.2178, -0.3315, -2.6765, -2.6562, -0.7073, -1.9353, -2.5709,  0.7661])
I also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs, then you would be looking at paying $25 and up. | tensor([ 6.2240,  0.0952, -1.5597, -2.0344, -1.3939, -2.9260, -2.7248,  2.6527])
\n\nMy biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness, this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel. | tensor([ 8.1225, -1.0734, -2.6117, -2.4534, -0.4288, -2.0800, -2.2654,  0.2553])
I did complete one or two V7 or V8. | tensor([ 8.7022, -1.9441, -2.3924, -2.6030, -0.2815, -2.2083, -1.8366, -0.2561])
Just to push myself | tensor([ 7.1435, -1.0178, -3.4196, -0.8768,  0.5850, -2.8904, -2.9415,  1.3212])
but I would have had more fun if I had the support of a rope | tensor([ 6.8402,  0.0180, -2.7443, -1.3741, -0.7332, -2.6519, -2.3169,  1.7162])
so the next time I go back I will consider classes. | tensor([ 8.5741, -2.0035, -1.6129, -2.6334, -1.2152, -1.5119, -2.1356, -0.2679])
Which costs a little bit more | tensor([ 8.2924, -1.6755, -2.2146, -2.7888, -0.5841, -1.4252, -1.9398, -0.5107])
oh well. | tensor([ 8.2865, -2.4177, -1.5997, -2.7334,  0.2619, -1.6010, -2.3778, -0.5761])
Class times are limited check the website. | tensor([ 8.6616, -2.2899, -1.9895, -2.4470, -0.3474, -2.2415, -1.2310, -1.0111])
Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:\n\n-A one-day pass is $12. | tensor([-1.8960,  1.1615, -0.3599,  2.4745, -0.5944, -4.0602, -0.0182,  3.7490])
 College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit). | tensor([ 6.3626, -3.3370, -1.8524, -3.9858,  2.3607, -1.4504, -0.6308, -0.9759])
 Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra. | tensor([ 0.7600, -1.4795, -2.3688, -1.9533,  8.1471, -0.9840, -2.5390,  0.5740])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Yup, you heard me right. | tensor([ 8.5965, -1.9817, -2.2639, -2.6345, -0.3998, -1.5398, -1.9013, -0.6077])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.\n\n-They run a different membership special every month. | tensor([ 7.9169, -2.4765, -1.9682, -2.1080, -1.4681, -1.0112, -0.3472, -1.6383])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.\n\n- | tensor([ 8.3878, -2.4844, -1.8804, -2.1044, -0.8380, -2.0809, -1.0319, -1.2323])
If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the \"bouldering certification\" instead of the \"safety and belay certification class.\"   | tensor([ 8.2867, -1.9404, -2.2563, -2.2495, -0.5804, -2.7643, -1.7984,  0.5899])
The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing. | tensor([ 3.3729, -1.0649, -2.1428, -1.5992, -0.0552, -3.2370, -1.2708,  4.2352])
 Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.\n\n- | tensor([ 8.3769, -2.3135, -2.0798, -2.5744, -0.2729, -1.5561, -2.1555, -0.2598])
If you \"like\" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc. | tensor([ 7.3182, -2.6942, -1.5186, -0.7331, -2.1363, -1.8068,  0.4694, -2.0416])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
\n\nThe wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op. | tensor([ 8.1288, -2.6194, -1.8662, -1.7888, -0.3047, -2.6373, -1.1314, -0.6782])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities. | tensor([ 8.1787, -1.4518, -2.7940, -2.1787, -0.9070, -0.6776, -2.0931, -0.4501])
Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. | tensor([ 7.3164, -1.9704,  0.2447, -2.8647, -1.3989, -1.9470, -2.6647,  0.7483])
It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. | tensor([ 8.5896, -1.7460, -2.1807, -2.5437, -1.0307, -1.6676, -2.3169,  0.1771])
I miss it! | tensor([ 8.3224, -2.0985, -1.7372, -2.7642, -0.8601, -0.6061, -2.3333, -0.6382])
The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. | tensor([ 8.5909, -1.6917, -2.1532, -2.1451, -0.6825, -1.9361, -2.2961, -0.4541])
Staff has always been awesome. | tensor([ 8.6533, -2.0676, -2.2671, -2.6088, -0.3204, -2.0706, -1.6714, -0.4868])
People there help give pointers. | tensor([ 8.3156, -2.3749, -2.0098, -1.4276, -0.0705, -2.1250, -2.2903, -0.6643])
It does get pretty crowded sometimes, especially on Friday nights. | tensor([ 5.4574,  0.2097, -2.6498, -2.4615, -1.8971,  2.9585, -2.8819,  0.7025])
I'd say they are almost in need of an expansion! | tensor([ 8.0007, -2.1920, -0.1863, -2.1641, -2.1983, -0.7597, -1.6904, -1.4171])
Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. | tensor([ 8.6598, -2.1634, -1.5948, -2.0882, -0.8686, -2.1946, -1.5829, -1.0244])
I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :) | tensor([ 8.6746, -2.2429, -2.3982, -2.5058,  0.2560, -1.8895, -1.9624, -0.7854])
I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. | tensor([ 8.5355, -1.7051, -1.8810, -2.3036, -0.9972, -2.0620, -2.4065,  0.0569])
This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together. | tensor([ 8.5949, -1.6448, -2.0751, -2.2842, -0.8300, -1.6990, -2.4172, -0.2885])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. | tensor([ 8.4813, -1.9169, -1.9582, -2.4992, -0.9372, -1.5997, -2.1661, -0.1240])
It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. | tensor([ 8.2479, -2.0671, -2.0330, -1.9123, -1.2121, -1.0186, -2.4868, -0.1142])
The staff are amazing! | tensor([ 8.6060, -1.6353, -2.3872, -2.5382, -0.3597, -1.5753, -1.7815, -0.9771])
Very nice and very helpful. | tensor([ 8.5250, -2.3710, -2.3782, -2.4566,  0.0163, -1.6775, -1.6125, -1.0543])
The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). | tensor([ 8.3986, -1.9074, -1.9653, -2.0468, -1.0747, -2.2185, -2.3800,  0.3961])
I definitely recommend climbing here. | tensor([ 8.4930, -1.8619, -2.0801, -2.8214, -0.3789, -1.4497, -2.1384, -0.5254])
As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating, but the staff at The Climbing Wall helped me get on the right path. | tensor([ 4.8510,  0.3752, -2.8129, -1.0531, -0.3833, -3.1774, -2.8417,  4.1006])
Also, the regulars here seemed very nice and always willing to help out a newbie. | tensor([ 6.2766, -1.5658, -2.9813, -0.5598,  0.8340,  0.7220, -2.5129, -1.8952])
It isn't very expensive either, 10 or 12 bucks for a full day of bouldering is a very reasonable deal (I haven't seen many places which were cheaper). | tensor([ 7.9454, -0.7846, -1.9969, -2.3770, -1.2545, -2.7450, -2.3752,  1.1816])
\n\nI'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. | tensor([ 8.1166, -0.8108, -2.4744, -2.4089, -1.5880, -1.3012, -2.4307,  0.5997])
It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. | tensor([ 8.6646, -2.0735, -2.0500, -1.9237, -0.7764, -2.5699, -1.7102, -0.4875])
The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style. | tensor([ 8.5593, -1.7858, -2.2931, -1.9107, -0.6020, -2.0675, -2.3516, -0.2481])
\n\nThe overall experience was wonderful: great staff, great people, and a great setup. | tensor([ 8.6186, -1.9558, -2.4442, -2.5075, -0.4317, -1.7600, -1.6684, -0.6263])
\n\nTip: If you're a beginner without your own equipment, the shoe rental is worth the extra 3 or 4 bucks. | tensor([ 7.4040,  0.2348, -3.0493, -1.5777, -0.9418, -2.0470, -1.8892, -0.1373])
I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!) | tensor([ 3.2522,  0.6195, -1.9726, -1.1538, -3.1624,  2.1286, -1.9198,  1.6150])
I wish they would expand their hours. | tensor([ 8.5723, -1.9206, -2.2167, -2.3588, -0.7885, -1.5811, -2.0275, -0.3724])
Otherwise, they make a nice effort to change their routes relatively often. | tensor([ 5.7239, -2.9525,  0.3571, -1.5600, -3.1280,  0.8082, -0.1865, -2.2458])
Dirty slick holds. | tensor([ 8.2149, -1.8389, -2.4667, -3.2424,  0.0367, -1.0234, -2.2260, -0.2074])
Hate the fact I can't move mats. | tensor([ 8.6487, -1.9663, -2.0401, -2.3147, -0.7703, -1.7545, -1.6127, -0.8503])
Some problems were fun, some were awful. | tensor([ 8.4951, -2.2792, -2.3473, -2.2416, -0.2427, -1.6822, -1.6547, -0.9716])
The staff is very unfriendly. | tensor([ 8.7121, -2.0116, -2.2577, -2.3144, -0.6510, -1.8985, -1.1708, -1.3559])
Unless you're part if the clique no one will talk to you. | tensor([ 6.3569, -2.2715, -1.9480, -4.0000, -0.1604, -0.9959,  2.3251, -2.1817])
Sub-par setting quality, infrequent wall resetting, inconsistent grading, poor climate control, poor air quality (no chalk filter), silly rule where they make everyone wear paper wristbands before entry. | tensor([ 8.4367, -1.5922, -2.4189, -2.0395, -0.8495, -2.1060, -1.5154, -0.5700])
+ 1 star because they are finally installing air conditioning. | tensor([ 8.4030, -1.9799, -1.4434, -2.0260, -1.8185, -1.5137, -1.1123, -0.9884])
At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- | tensor([ 7.5679, -1.4139, -1.6811, -1.8722, -0.9279, -2.8074, -2.4354,  1.2366])
I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. | tensor([ 8.6053, -2.2707, -2.0364, -1.9687, -0.8772, -2.2160, -1.3024, -0.8026])
The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. | tensor([ 8.6612, -1.7516, -2.2275, -2.2820, -0.4243, -2.1321, -1.9885, -0.5969])
\n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \"Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \"If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\" I was in shock. | tensor([ 8.4378, -0.9364, -2.8888, -2.1821,  0.4015, -3.0459, -1.8040, -0.3569])
Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? | tensor([ 8.4808, -2.0020, -2.2475, -2.2092, -0.2139, -2.1343, -1.9164, -0.8167])
Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. | tensor([ 7.8787, -1.0648, -2.8581, -2.5148,  0.6232, -2.5703, -2.0108,  0.3406])
\n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. | tensor([ 7.7826, -1.3814, -2.7376, -1.8792, -0.4814, -2.9268, -1.8838,  1.5459])
I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. | tensor([ 3.1307,  1.5339, -2.9849, -0.6383, -1.3489, -2.2690, -1.4341,  4.0487])
I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. | tensor([ 8.6209, -1.8078, -2.7081, -2.8098,  0.1874, -2.0882, -1.7346, -0.5223])
But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. | tensor([ 7.9641, -0.5626, -3.1281, -2.7418,  0.5638, -2.7331, -2.2639,  0.7918])
\n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. | tensor([ 8.0555, -1.6014, -1.8656, -3.1973, -1.2399, -0.6494, -2.0016,  0.1473])
It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. | tensor([ 5.7067,  0.7377, -1.4225, -1.9759, -1.8108, -0.4064, -2.6759,  1.5389])
\n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here. | tensor([ 8.5398, -2.3555, -2.1812, -2.6166, -0.3116, -1.8063, -1.3297, -1.0873])
I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing. | tensor([ 8.5481, -1.8583, -1.8148, -2.2924, -1.0426, -1.8728, -2.3148, -0.0379])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
They've never belayed and don't have equipment | tensor([ 8.1104, -2.7409, -0.5770, -2.3137, -1.8201, -1.6392, -1.6561, -0.3555])
so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\n\nDreams crushed. | tensor([ 8.5344, -2.0341, -2.0002, -2.2847, -0.8822, -2.0231, -1.6539, -0.4727])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room. | tensor([ 8.4083, -2.3680, -1.7731, -2.0730, -0.7469, -1.8179, -1.9744, -0.4690])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\n\nSo we bouldered. | tensor([ 8.6269, -2.1959, -2.1044, -2.2838, -0.7142, -1.9277, -1.6398, -0.6940])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another. | tensor([ 8.4545, -1.2702, -2.2466, -2.1849, -1.1222, -2.0001, -1.9263, -0.3117])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss. | tensor([ 8.5848, -2.2830, -1.9935, -1.9440, -0.5271, -2.0763, -1.5839, -0.8361])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion. | tensor([ 6.7668,  1.0343, -3.1709, -0.9097, -1.1973, -2.8039, -2.3178,  0.7019])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Those were only on the overhanging walls.\n\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.   | tensor([ 7.5342, -0.3114, -3.0161, -1.7318, -0.8692, -2.4021, -2.1203,  1.0463])
I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\n\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area. | tensor([ 7.9058, -0.8547, -3.2466, -1.0746, -0.5519, -2.9554, -0.8814, -0.7040])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\n\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh. | tensor([ 8.1235, -0.8586, -2.6922, -2.5583, -0.9789, -1.8100, -2.4893,  1.0411])
There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.   | tensor([ 7.9604, -0.9503, -2.4651, -0.5893, -0.9126, -3.2632, -2.5604,  0.5036])
I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \n\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap. | tensor([ 3.9871,  1.5833, -3.4984, -2.5623,  1.8482, -1.8084, -2.9225,  3.3153])

And the bouldering area is really quite good.   | tensor([ 8.6507, -1.7590, -2.1269, -2.4037, -0.6978, -2.0755, -2.2156, -0.2325])
To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. | tensor([ 8.5002, -1.4168, -2.5463, -2.6145, -0.3937, -2.4342, -1.7209, -0.1694])
There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area. | tensor([ 8.6181, -1.9093, -2.1333, -2.6775, -0.6234, -1.7536, -1.5988, -0.6865])
 Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. | tensor([ 8.6086, -2.0305, -2.1918, -2.4216, -0.5662, -1.9311, -1.7622, -0.5161])
\n\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent. | tensor([ 7.8850, -0.5682, -2.6847, -1.5781, -1.0583, -2.5367, -2.2997,  0.4936])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon. | tensor([ 8.6621, -1.3527, -2.4108, -2.6188, -0.4194, -1.6864, -1.7447, -0.9722])

The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. | tensor([ 8.6308, -1.9590, -2.0841, -2.1191, -1.1112, -1.7620, -1.8265, -0.6375])
\n\n\nNow the downsides. | tensor([ 8.1717e+00, -2.4217e+00, -2.3159e+00, -2.7019e+00,  8.1169e-03,

The staff wasn't very helpful. | tensor([ 8.4786, -1.3844, -2.8059, -2.4667, -0.0741, -1.8811, -1.8404, -0.6741])

The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. | tensor([ 8.6151, -1.9444, -2.1831, -2.6238, -0.5918, -2.2352, -1.8578, -0.0658])
I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. | tensor([ 8.4361, -2.2188, -1.9116, -1.5663, -0.8918, -2.5187, -2.0607, -0.1213])
Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.   | tensor([ 4.7852,  2.7374, -2.9920, -2.5882, -0.1400, -2.7616, -2.0353,  2.6957])
It's poor form. | tensor([ 8.4956, -1.9213, -2.1611, -2.3952, -0.4935, -1.3098, -2.0941, -0.7666])
\n\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull. | tensor([ 6.8026, -2.0673, -1.9818, -0.4730, -1.4694, -2.7497, -1.6128,  1.3973])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground. | tensor([ 7.5425, -2.8489, -1.4044, -2.9525, -0.0606, -0.4055, -1.2558, -1.5199])
  | tensor([ 8.0307, -2.2688, -2.1217, -2.9378, -0.1605, -0.4471, -2.3397, -0.4265])
I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. | tensor([ 4.0649,  0.3843, -3.1337, -1.7653,  2.0127, -2.7281, -3.6526,  4.1609])
The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. | tensor([ 8.6061, -2.2689, -2.2340, -2.0407, -0.6796, -2.4212, -1.4375, -0.5722])
They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. | tensor([ 8.5249, -2.2071, -2.1152, -2.3602, -0.7458, -1.4761, -1.6785, -0.7044])
\n\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.   | tensor([ 5.8318, -1.9986, -2.0299, -3.9491, -1.1496,  3.5703, -1.1691, -0.3844])
Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned. | tensor([ 8.6177, -2.2137, -1.7705, -3.1449, -1.0391, -1.5005, -1.4357, -0.4461])

Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous. | tensor([ 8.4524, -2.2307, -2.1762, -2.6012, -0.6456, -0.7702, -1.8015, -0.8996])
 \n\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean. | tensor([ 0.1907,  0.5924, -1.7134, -1.4127, -0.5698, -0.3196, -2.1165,  5.4915])

I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity. | tensor([ 8.5391, -2.4599, -1.9737, -2.4689, -0.3719, -1.6807, -1.5037, -1.0970])
Don't go. | tensor([ 8.5560, -2.1129, -2.3264, -2.7335, -0.1037, -1.8338, -1.9893, -0.3408])
I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable! | tensor([ 8.6159, -1.8344, -2.3593, -2.4655, -0.5134, -1.4772, -2.1821, -0.2937])
This place is looking to make money and rip you off. | tensor([ 8.6006, -2.2925, -1.7269, -2.3396, -0.8561, -1.9602, -1.1756, -1.3344])

The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection. | tensor([ 8.6352, -1.9626, -2.2800, -2.5666, -0.4855, -1.9052, -2.0058, -0.2037])

Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it. | tensor([ 8.2036, -2.2418, -0.7477, -1.5141, -1.5206, -1.5919, -1.8292, -1.5491])

Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem. | tensor([ 8.6425, -2.2439, -2.0479, -1.9877, -0.3466, -2.5035, -1.8357, -0.5802])
 Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you. | tensor([ 5.9169, -3.0910,  1.2761, -2.5376, -2.1842, -1.5380, -1.0003,  0.0828])
I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant, and they also offer the best food for the price. | tensor([ 8.3208, -1.9365, -2.0677, -1.7400, -1.2555, -2.2317, -2.0993,  0.2096])
 \n\nThe menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese). | tensor([ 7.9254, -1.4776, -2.6186, -2.3853, -0.1157, -0.5042, -1.9151, -1.1761])

In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine. | tensor([ 8.2218, -2.7148, -0.6200, -2.7664, -1.1546, -1.1130, -1.8121, -1.2556])

The government of this state is partly to blame though. | tensor([ 8.6423, -2.2461, -1.8750, -2.7020, -0.7498, -1.4600, -1.2883, -1.3284])

Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!   | tensor([ 8.1634, -2.2922, -1.6071, -2.9465, -1.1229, -0.5168, -1.1008, -1.1678])
But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...\n\nAnyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor. | tensor([ 8.4920, -2.3380, -2.5452, -2.4492,  0.1908, -1.8721, -1.3899, -0.8111])

Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem. | tensor([ 7.4936, -1.6151, -3.0789, -3.2121,  0.8244, -0.6915, -0.9613, -1.2301])
OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago. | tensor([ 8.2527, -2.1070, -2.4311, -1.6443, -0.3801, -1.9709, -2.3050,  0.0933])

And then I didn't go for a long time. | tensor([ 8.1875, -2.0638, -1.9542, -2.6231,  0.0110, -1.9529, -2.2697,  0.0619])

A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!   | tensor([ 1.1565, -1.9834, -1.6604, -1.9140,  6.1306, -1.2259, -1.9767,  1.1017])
It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\n\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese. | tensor([ 2.3176, -2.9766,  1.6768, -2.5385, -2.3127,  6.5412, -1.8360, -1.7868])

That being said, it is mighty delicious. | tensor([ 8.5466, -2.0135, -2.2313, -2.0804, -0.5687, -1.4690, -1.9508, -0.9906])

I love the corn bread. | tensor([ 2.2868, -0.7595,  1.1334, -2.3820, -1.2398,  4.6701, -2.5171, -1.2370])

The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous. | tensor([ 7.9340, -1.5863, -1.9213, -1.3441, -1.1727, -1.6982, -1.8206, -0.8405])

But when we get them, they are lovely too. | tensor([ 8.4536, -2.0118, -2.3464, -2.7913,  0.3732, -1.5500, -2.2711, -0.6855])

I love the ambiance. | tensor([ 3.1449,  1.7740, -1.2922, -0.5507, -1.6971,  1.9177, -2.1688, -0.8259])

In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology. | tensor([ 8.3363, -2.4759, -2.4160, -1.9469,  0.3488, -1.8194, -2.0531, -0.4661])
Lamb burger was outright bad(tasted off and charred). | tensor([ 8.5866, -2.1971, -2.3595, -2.6596, -0.2199, -2.1723, -1.3124, -0.7078])
We shared and together only ate half. | tensor([ 8.5491, -1.9263, -2.1136, -2.8829, -0.4251, -1.8591, -2.1496, -0.0618])
The filet was decent but not $25 worth of decent. | tensor([ 8.5394, -2.2083, -2.3826, -3.0822, -0.0575, -1.5557, -1.4288, -0.7809])
Waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. | tensor([ 8.2882, -1.8545, -2.5089, -2.0056, -0.0916, -2.5820, -1.8130, -0.2537])
There are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion, this isn't one of them. | tensor([ 8.0881, -1.2626, -2.1444, -2.6414, -0.5150, -0.8508, -2.4218, -0.7513])
I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back...... | tensor([ 8.7261, -2.2861, -2.0673, -2.2516, -0.5080, -2.1222, -1.6665, -0.8664])
ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option | tensor([ 7.8390, -2.3762, -0.8637, -1.9868, -1.9248, -1.8064, -0.6544, -1.3789])
The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. | tensor([ 8.4098, -2.5568, -2.3396, -1.6323,  0.0322, -2.2456, -1.6961, -0.6875])
I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. | tensor([ 8.5886, -2.0009, -1.3693, -2.3692, -1.1221, -1.9203, -2.1615, -0.3807])
I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. | tensor([ 8.2949, -2.1944, -2.5025, -2.2840,  0.0465, -1.8718, -2.3623,  0.0124])
My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit | tensor([ 6.8716, -1.5278, -2.6663, -3.1614,  2.8718, -2.2309, -3.1191,  1.0119])

Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. | tensor([ 7.9766, -1.1699, -1.4471, -1.5543, -0.6761, -2.5596, -2.9245,  0.0317])
We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. | tensor([ 4.8404, -1.7312, -2.3266,  1.3220,  0.0372,  0.1288, -1.7006, -1.5956])

We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. | tensor([ 8.2047, -2.6076, -1.8824, -1.4511, -1.0407, -1.5864, -1.6115, -0.6113])

Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park. | tensor([ 3.5714, -0.4049, -2.7100,  1.2091,  0.3513, -1.8484, -1.1007, -0.0386])

The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.   | tensor([ 3.5141,  2.6430, -3.3340,  0.2541,  1.0658, -1.2009, -1.3223, -1.8244])

Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. | tensor([ 8.6438, -2.1489, -1.8451, -2.1952, -0.6379, -1.8439, -2.0381, -0.7518])
At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. | tensor([ 2.0269, -0.9039, -2.9571, -1.4280,  4.2061, -0.0808,  0.2122, -1.9673])
I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. | tensor([ 8.3989, -2.4474, -1.6636, -2.3719, -1.1346, -1.9866, -0.5291, -1.5530])
Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. | tensor([ 8.6609, -1.8587, -2.3896, -2.5834, -0.2884, -2.2042, -1.8468, -0.3845])
Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.\n\nOK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: \nthis is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! | tensor([ 0.5073, -2.6922,  2.7813, -0.7793, -2.5169,  2.1432, -0.1830, -0.2392])
It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. | tensor([ 7.0754, -1.7594, -2.9350, -1.7711,  2.3620, -1.9498, -2.3458, -0.8322])
I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.\n\nNow, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. | tensor([ 5.7524, -1.0286, -2.1105,  1.3957, -1.2636, -2.7948, -1.8707, -0.2224])

For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! | tensor([ 8.3591, -1.4151, -1.7276, -2.5422, -0.9447, -1.5678, -1.9619, -0.8630])
The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. | tensor([-0.0956, -0.4017, -2.1973,  7.2481,  0.8011, -1.5305, -2.6246, -1.0941])
We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!\n\nTo sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff! | tensor([ 7.8892, -1.5559, -3.2460, -2.7245,  1.5044, -1.5716, -1.8798, -0.8434])

 2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good). | tensor([ 8.1111, -1.8999, -2.9327, -2.0073,  1.0612, -2.3766, -1.9259, -0.7908])

I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily. | tensor([ 8.1236, -1.8830, -2.3966, -1.9845, -0.7951, -1.2220, -1.2432, -1.3067])

The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies. | tensor([ 5.7397, -1.2085, -2.3527,  1.2238, -0.6271, -1.7904, -2.6395, -0.5708])

Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered! | tensor([ 1.6037,  0.5628, -2.1394,  2.9237,  1.3779,  0.6407, -2.1066, -2.1340])
 \n\"Would you care for some dessert?\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked. | tensor([ 7.4981, -1.9091, -2.0650, -2.0532, -0.6143, -0.7406, -1.7573, -1.0121])

Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.   | tensor([ 8.6545, -1.9086, -2.6947, -1.9269,  0.0414, -2.4357, -1.8109, -0.7255])
The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered. | tensor([ 8.3953, -2.3656, -2.1696, -1.7556, -0.8077, -1.9965, -1.7378, -0.4644])

Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.   | tensor([ 8.3490, -2.4409, -2.3182, -1.3668, -0.2162, -1.7568, -1.9605, -0.7683])
And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM. | tensor([ 8.2316, -2.6685, -1.8300, -2.3645, -0.6719, -1.4665, -1.1867, -0.9821])
Recently dined here for the first time and can say that I was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment. | tensor([ 8.6361, -1.4664, -2.0368, -2.1328, -0.8764, -2.0930, -2.1003, -0.6148])
The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. | tensor([ 2.1687,  2.1277, -2.7358,  1.2197,  0.1099,  0.6281, -1.8489, -1.2881])

The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. | tensor([ 8.5048, -2.0099, -1.2939, -2.0024, -1.1940, -2.1047, -1.7342, -1.0306])
It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation. | tensor([ 7.9599, -0.6793, -2.5131, -2.1954, -0.7458, -2.8097, -2.0135,  0.6317])
Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. | tensor([ 5.8027, -3.1937,  1.0739, -1.9299, -2.3815,  0.9409, -1.9465, -0.2703])
Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. | tensor([ 8.6377, -2.2733, -2.3331, -2.6034, -0.3374, -1.7357, -1.4804, -0.8314])
Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\n\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. | tensor([-0.6445, -3.1938,  3.7780, -1.3393, -2.3806,  5.5607, -0.8160, -1.3171])
The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. | tensor([ 8.3386, -1.7359, -2.1371, -1.8015, -0.7415, -2.2035, -1.2345, -1.1304])

The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). | tensor([ 8.1027, -0.6966, -2.2528, -2.2695, -1.0945, -1.6136, -2.2397, -0.3343])
The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. | tensor([ 8.5070, -1.9877, -2.3420, -1.8623, -0.8645, -2.3341, -1.4566, -0.5037])
