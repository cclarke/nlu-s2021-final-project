Typical bone regeneration -- wherein bone is taken from a patient’s hip and grafted onto damaged bone elsewhere in the body -- is limited and can cause great pain just a few years after operation. | tensor([ 5.3506, -2.0858, -3.0902])

Many of those with severe speech disorders use a computerized device to communicate. | tensor([ 1.4311, -1.3284, -0.7729])
Yet they choose between only a few voice options. | tensor([ 5.2750, -2.0227, -3.0913])
That's why Stephen Hawking has an American accent, and why many people end up with the same voice, often to incongruous effect. | tensor([-1.2819, -1.1247,  3.4862])
Speech scientist Rupal Patel wanted to do something about this, and in this wonderful talk she shares her work to engineer unique voices for the voiceless. | tensor([ 5.1773, -2.0074, -3.0069])

We're all familiar with satellite imagery, but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date. | tensor([ 5.4494, -2.1080, -3.1420])
That's because satellites are big and expensive, so there aren't that many of them up in space. | tensor([ 4.1858, -1.8764, -2.4291])

Nicolas Perony studies how individual animals -- be they Scottish Terriers, bats or meerkats -- follow simple rules that, collectively, create larger patterns of behavior. | tensor([ 5.2765, -2.0478, -3.0533])
And how this complexity born of simplicity can help them adapt to new circumstances, as they arise. | tensor([ 5.4898, -2.0815, -3.1838])

McKenna Pope's younger brother loved to cook, but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven -- because it was a toy for girls. | tensor([ 1.3443, -0.9937, -0.6433])
So at age 13, Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing. | tensor([ 4.9364, -1.9772, -2.8533])
