Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 4.5455, -5.7857])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. | tensor([ 4.4060, -5.7208])
Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 4.5469, -5.6841])
 \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. | tensor([ 4.3895, -5.2215])
 Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. | tensor([ 4.5445, -5.7354])
When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly. | tensor([ 4.6739, -5.8115])
i hear that the mojave road is amazing!<br />\nsearch for it online. | tensor([ 4.6265, -5.8455])
Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. | tensor([ 3.9809, -4.7477])
The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises "bad" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. | tensor([ 2.4268, -2.3250])
\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. | tensor([ 2.9200, -3.0471])
In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods. | tensor([ 4.5780, -5.7692])

renting vs buying depends on your goals. | tensor([ 4.4295, -5.7385])
<br />\ngenerally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. | tensor([ 4.6919, -5.7703])
the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.\nhaving said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). | tensor([ 4.6820, -5.7116])
it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.\nbottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. | tensor([ 4.7115, -5.8198])
the other numbers tend to even out, the main gain or loss in buying comes from appreciation/depreciation. | tensor([ 4.5782, -5.8373])
There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning. | tensor([ 4.6542, -5.7603])
\nAfter turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles. | tensor([ 2.1589, -2.0762])
\nUse the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys. \nDampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys. | tensor([ 2.9480, -3.0178])
\nUse the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris. | tensor([ 1.6713, -1.6395])
<br />\nIf | tensor([ 4.4243, -5.2468])
you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. | tensor([ 2.9963, -3.1173])
If you are still feeling industrious, next you can tackle cleaning your mouse. | tensor([ 2.8931, -2.9683])
\nOf course, if cleaning your keyboard seems a truly undesirable task, you can always buy a new one for around $20. | tensor([ 3.3778, -3.6770])
from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. | tensor([ 4.6115, -5.5671])
It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "fight or flight" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. | tensor([ 4.1142, -4.8967])
<br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. | tensor([ 2.4887, -2.4325])
As a result of the "fight or flight" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. | tensor([ 4.5236, -5.4928])
\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. | tensor([ 3.5256, -3.9038])
The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. | tensor([ 4.0826, -4.8402])
\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. | tensor([ 2.4117, -2.3968])
So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness. | tensor([ 4.2403, -5.0030])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Everyone has different definition on what 'beauty' is. | tensor([ 4.4609, -5.7332])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
I like Lin Qingxia, but I think many girls are prettier than she was. | tensor([ 2.5661, -2.4894])
(She is more than 40 years old now). | tensor([ 4.7485, -5.8182])
"Lin Qingxia" is the most beautiful woman in the Chinese cinema, the most handsome man in Chinese cinema should be "Chin Han" because they always made movies together.\nHowever, A male movie star once was asked his girlfriend in real life or the girlfriend in movie is more beautiful.   | tensor([ 4.1370, -4.8038])
He gave a very good answer: "I think my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world." | tensor([ 4.5226, -5.3889])
 :) | tensor([ 4.6788, -5.8587])
Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film "Tango & Cash". | tensor([ 4.3154, -5.6309])
After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. | tensor([ 2.1993, -2.1529])
Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass, their conversation was as follows:\nGabriel Cash: I don't know about you, but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...\nRay | tensor([-1.3048,  1.1175])
What's F.U.B.A.R.?\nGabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition. | tensor([-3.4157,  3.6847])
A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. | tensor([ 4.4847, -5.7380])
Since you asked "how the human species evolved? | tensor([ 4.6884, -5.8480])
" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. | tensor([ 4.6359, -5.8493])
Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. | tensor([ 4.4610, -5.7111])
The pressures for "fit" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). | tensor([ 4.5557, -5.8037])
These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology. | tensor([ 4.4958, -5.4859])
That is kind of a tricky little quote. | tensor([ 4.2897, -5.1605])
Sometimes placing it in context can help. | tensor([ 4.4477, -5.7117])
This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self Reliance," which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). | tensor([ 4.6239, -5.8731])
\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. | tensor([ 4.7268, -5.7682])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the "independence of solitude"). | tensor([ 4.6833, -5.8770])
However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. | tensor([ 4.7402, -5.8671])
Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a "finished man" can truly do. | tensor([ 4.7317, -5.8763])
Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. | tensor([ 3.5069, -3.9391])
So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced "perfect sweetness" comes in. | tensor([ 4.6131, -5.7664])
When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. | tensor([ 3.9014, -4.3990])
\nWhat do you think? | tensor([ 4.7585, -5.8332])
There are several websites that you can find rare or out of print books. | tensor([ 4.5516, -5.7599])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
A couple would be alibris.com or abebooks.com. | tensor([ 4.6187, -5.8401])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
These sites list books by booksellers all over the country and some internationally. | tensor([ 4.5388, -5.7427])
the most basic thing is to have someone you have a decent amount of trust for. | tensor([ 4.7409, -5.8224])
someone recommended by a friend etc.\nthe things you have to look for are:<br />\n1. | tensor([ 4.7552, -5.8794])
top priority is seeing that the broker can actually get your loan on time. | tensor([ 4.6907, -5.9091])
many deals fall through b/c the broker cannot get the deal through on time and has less control than the original lender<br />\n2. | tensor([ 4.7332, -5.8733])
secondary priority is to see that they have access to competitive rates. | tensor([ 4.4991, -5.7726])
not all brokers have access to all sources and rates, although most of them will be similar.<br />\n3. | tensor([ 4.6384, -5.8517])
you need to see that the broker is someone you trust to get you the best rate regardless of how much money they make off the transaction. | tensor([ 4.7131, -5.9053])
Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD. | tensor([ 4.6987, -5.8921])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you. | tensor([ 4.6091, -5.6490])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.\nIf you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ . | tensor([ 4.6318, -5.8158])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This process is not very straightforward though.\nIf you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS. | tensor([ 4.6069, -5.6179])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want. | tensor([ 4.6529, -5.8737])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs. | tensor([ 4.6312, -5.8718])
IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values, needs, etc.). | tensor([ 4.7259, -5.8320])
Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce, and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want, and you get an increasing percentage.\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.\nA parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life? | tensor([ 4.6061, -5.5751])

Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number, as in i^2 = -1, where i is the imaginary number. | tensor([ 4.4019, -5.4294])
You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 | tensor([ 4.5258, -5.6227])
(that's the square root of -1).\nDon't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math, such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. | tensor([ 4.6159, -5.7318])
The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones, it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :) | tensor([ 4.6743, -5.8733])

There are some experiments where splitting entangled electrons allows us to observe some interesting 'action at a distance' effects, but the amount of data that would need to be stored to transmit something with as many atoms as a pizza is incredible.   | tensor([ 4.4305, -5.3792])
Also, such an operation would require nano-assemblers that could interpret such data an reassemble the pizza from the info provided. | tensor([ 4.5796, -5.5801])
CCM Magazine or their online website will give you information on up and coming artists in the Christian Music field. | tensor([ 4.4604, -5.7404])
You also need to consider the economic effects of funding basic research. | tensor([ 4.5244, -5.8183])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The moon missions of the 60's inspired an entire generation and helped to move many kids toward careers in science and engineering. | tensor([ 4.6234, -5.8032])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
As a result, the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades. | tensor([ 4.6658, -5.8704])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions. | tensor([ 4.6817, -5.8898])
The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. | tensor([ 3.3398, -3.5828])
It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. | tensor([ 4.4809, -5.6505])
Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in. | tensor([ 4.5117, -5.5555])
Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). | tensor([ 4.3337, -5.2269])
Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. | tensor([ 3.4601, -3.7452])
Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. | tensor([ 3.5771, -4.0891])
Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. | tensor([ 4.1637, -4.9261])
If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. | tensor([ 4.5721, -5.5948])
This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. | tensor([ 4.5992, -5.6962])
For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium. | tensor([ 4.6180, -5.6960])

I can't tell you which of the many are best, but I can tell you about one I lived in briefly.\nI lived for a month in the Avalon at 4th and King. | tensor([ 4.7048, -5.8383])
I was put up there as a corporate apartment. | tensor([ 4.7036, -5.8456])
While it was fine, it was relatively expensive, and the rooms were small. | tensor([ 4.6522, -5.8702])
It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. | tensor([ 4.2799, -5.5347])
I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms, which are particularly American. | tensor([ 4.6503, -5.6671])
The smell of cooking, people watching TV, people eating -- these all seem like activities that should be separated from one another. | tensor([ 4.0211, -4.7601])
Call me old fashioned. | tensor([ 3.9930, -4.6333])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
\nThe Avalon had a big gym, however, which was very good, and concierge service, which was very convenient. | tensor([ 4.1187, -4.7714])
Most of them were very friendly. | tensor([ 4.7359, -5.7459])
One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!   | tensor([ 4.0293, -4.6134])
Also convenient was its proximity to the Caltrain, the Safeway across the street and the Starbucks. | tensor([ 4.6197, -5.7949])
But if you crave culture, this ain't it: everything is a chain store nearby.\nSo depending on your budget, your need for convenience and culture, and your tolerance for small rooms and/or omnirooms, it may suit you. | tensor([ 3.8847, -4.4692])

For the most part, the US congress has subsidized the creation of ethanol, which tends to be a net cost unless created from waste agricultural products.\nAnother substance that has the same anti-emissions properties as ethanol is MTBE. | tensor([ 4.5029, -5.4024])

There has been a lot of press about MTBE recently due to its tendency to pollute groundwater. | tensor([ 4.5571, -5.5444])
Same reason solar power isn't more popular despite lots of sunshine: with current technology the cost per kwh is still much higher than for power generated with fossil fuels. | tensor([ 4.6810, -5.8478])
As fossil fuel prices rise and technology improves so-called "alternative" energy sources become more cost effective, but the crossover point still appears to be several years in the future.\nForcing expensive alternative technologies on the market before they are economically viable simply raises electricity prices for homeowners--this is part of the reason CA electric rates were so far above the national average in the 1990's, opening the door for Enron and like to make their ill-fated arbitrage plays... | tensor([ 4.6442, -5.7068])

The engine weighs about 200 lbs. | tensor([ 3.0978, -3.4190])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\nBrakes- | tensor([ 3.4347, -3.7754])
The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.   | tensor([ 3.8574, -4.4951])
These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.   | tensor([ 4.5716, -5.6184])
They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing. | tensor([ 4.1448, -4.9153])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability. | tensor([ 4.3081, -5.5906])

As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking. | tensor([ 4.5223, -5.5345])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
An average person would black out in an F1 car.\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is. | tensor([ 3.5119, -3.8848])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers. | tensor([ 4.4845, -5.7435])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed. | tensor([ 4.3881, -5.4131])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.   | tensor([ 4.5384, -5.5711])
The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal | tensor([ 4.3851, -5.6613])
but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\nTransmisison- | tensor([ 4.7424, -5.9079])
The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions. | tensor([ 4.1370, -5.4565])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second. | tensor([ 4.0351, -4.7142])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
All the driver does is pull a lever. | tensor([ 3.9171, -4.6670])

The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. | tensor([ 4.5179, -5.7511])
\nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\nTires- | tensor([ 4.0798, -4.7436])
The tires are grooved to limit traction. | tensor([ 3.9593, -4.7996])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash. | tensor([ 4.0654, -4.8617])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.   | tensor([ 4.6258, -5.7827])
Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994). | tensor([ 4.2736, -5.6402])
First, I would never say that a theory has been proven. | tensor([ 4.5800, -5.7729])
There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. | tensor([ 4.5473, -5.7977])
A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... | tensor([ 4.7389, -5.8905])
I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. | tensor([ 4.4243, -5.7408])
Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory. | tensor([ 4.4808, -5.7718])

A helicopter gets its power from rotors or blades. | tensor([ 4.5409, -5.7885])
When its rotors are spinning, a helicopter doesn't look much like an airplane. | tensor([ 4.4910, -5.4167])
But the rotor blades have an airfoil shape like the wings of an airplane. | tensor([ 4.4444, -5.4713])
So as the rotors turn, air flows more quickly over the tops of the blades than it does below. | tensor([ 4.6328, -5.8216])
This creates enough lift for flight. | tensor([ 4.5135, -5.5408])
i would think to keep the "brand" recognition and the history of the Big Ten. | tensor([ 4.5190, -5.7973])

Massage is good for relieving stress if you find the right kind of you. | tensor([ 4.6252, -5.6057])
\nOne of the most popular massages is Swedish massage. | tensor([ 4.1737, -4.8526])
Light to medium pressure is applied with long, soothing strokes. | tensor([ 4.6365, -5.8163])
Sometimes stress can cause muscle pain. | tensor([ 4.0824, -4.8531])
Deep tissue massage can be tailored to the person's need. | tensor([ 4.6563, -5.7729])
Aromatherapy massage makes use of the therapeutic effect of essential oil combined with a relaxing massage. | tensor([ 4.6525, -5.7463])
Warm stone massage has become very popular in the past few years. | tensor([ 4.6326, -5.6497])
Reflexology is a special form of foot massage.\nIt may take a few trials to find the right kind of massage for you. | tensor([ 3.9986, -4.6734])
Once you find it, it can help maintain good physical health and stress reduction. | tensor([ 4.7315, -5.8278])
Check out "California Tenants:   | tensor([ 4.6372, -5.8570])

So the answer to your specific question is 'no'. | tensor([ 4.7445, -5.8863])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The problem is that if the container shines, it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out. | tensor([ 4.5935, -5.6812])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\nNow, to get more generalized... | tensor([ 4.5421, -5.4955])
it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. | tensor([ 4.3079, -5.2871])
Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam. | tensor([ 4.5199, -5.7150])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place. | tensor([ 4.5592, -5.6354])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way. | tensor([ 4.6430, -5.8259])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material. | tensor([ 4.3992, -5.2819])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics. | tensor([ 4.5388, -5.8154])
Their respective market caps are too close for this to ever happen.\nInterestingly, many reporters, analysts and tech pundits that I talk to think that the supposed competition between Google and Yahoo is fallacious, and that they are very different companies with very different strategies. | tensor([ 4.7145, -5.9006])
Google's true competitor is often seen as being Microsoft, not Yahoo. | tensor([ 4.6517, -5.8703])
This would support your claim that they are complementary. | tensor([ 4.5446, -5.7890])
It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.   | tensor([ 4.6306, -5.8542])
Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on. | tensor([ 4.6395, -5.7812])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state. | tensor([ 4.6401, -5.6780])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals. | tensor([ 4.5714, -5.5362])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
\nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.   | tensor([ 4.4488, -5.3356])
If this is so, then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses. | tensor([ 4.6660, -5.7527])
In the US, Trig is normally considered as a high school level course, however, it is not a required course to graduate. | tensor([ 4.6701, -5.8379])
I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.\nIn the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full "AP" Calculus, where the "AP" stands for "Advanced Placement" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College). | tensor([ 4.7179, -5.8807])
The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical.\n\nHere's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html\n\n"In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. | tensor([ 4.6970, -5.7788])
Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. | tensor([ 4.6594, -5.8100])
As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. | tensor([ 4.6223, -5.8552])
Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. | tensor([ 4.0467, -4.8076])
People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. | tensor([ 3.8926, -4.5671])
\n\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. | tensor([ 4.3215, -5.1356])
So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. | tensor([ 4.7159, -5.8710])
Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. | tensor([ 4.5742, -5.8127])
They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. | tensor([ 4.4721, -5.7210])
One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \n\nThen | tensor([ 2.1392, -2.0224])
an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. | tensor([ 4.3291, -5.5955])
He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. | tensor([ 4.6956, -5.8781])
He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. | tensor([ 4.5191, -5.7734])
Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\n\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. | tensor([ 4.4065, -5.2309])
Is it really too slow? | tensor([ 4.7224, -5.8688])
Why do they think it is slow? | tensor([ 4.6964, -5.8947])
How can we distract them? | tensor([ 4.7806, -5.8790])
How can we make it more comfortable? | tensor([ 4.6223, -5.8493])
Are customers scared of heights?\n\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. | tensor([ 3.3276, -3.5312])
They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. | tensor([ 4.6568, -5.8584])
\n\n\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. | tensor([ 3.0668, -3.1979])
\n\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. | tensor([ 4.3590, -5.1531])
This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. | tensor([ 4.6169, -5.7753])
Was their hair combed properly? | tensor([ 4.6148, -5.5393])
Did her makeup look okay?\n\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. | tensor([ 3.0556, -3.2131])
On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. | tensor([ 4.4713, -5.7511])
The elevator design itself had not changed at all." | tensor([ 4.4452, -5.6939])

The source of Gamma Ray bursts is currently unknown. | tensor([ 4.2739, -5.6149])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
They are a surprising phenomenon because gamma rays are so powerful that very few events could cause them. | tensor([ 4.5405, -5.6581])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
They have also only been recently discovered by projects like the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and appear to be coming from all directions, not just in the galactic plane.\nThis would indicate a phenomenon that has extra-galactic origins... for example, activity inside of an active galactic nuclei, or quasars.\nBecause they happen at random intervals, abd are ephemeral (often just a few seconds), and the "scopes" used to capture them are not tightly directional, we don't have any instruments currently that can figure out exactly what they are. | tensor([ 4.4504, -5.7245])

I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information. | tensor([ 4.6763, -5.8456])

However, Mark Twain had a point when he said "The coldest Winter I ever spent was Summer in San Francisco. | tensor([ 4.5067, -5.7798])
"\nThis is because the warm air from inland (where it gets quite hot in the Summer) clashes with the cold air from the surrounding Pacific Ocean and the SF Bay. | tensor([ 4.6008, -5.8356])

Further explanation from http://kids.earth.nasa.gov: "At night, the ground surface cools by radiating heat to space. | tensor([ 4.6401, -5.8177])

I think that the main reason is that obese people should be treated as drug addict. | tensor([ 1.8821, -1.8454])
The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. | tensor([ 2.1274, -2.0888])
Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. | tensor([ 3.8690, -4.5206])
Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets. | tensor([ 4.7099, -5.8522])
<br />\nAnother major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US, an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. | tensor([ 3.0693, -3.3415])

California electricity is generated by several sources, including hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and nuclear (in addition to the more traditional natural gas). | tensor([ 4.5188, -5.8183])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear). | tensor([ 4.6115, -5.8373])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up, and world demand for energy increases, the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.\nIncidentally, solar power is another source used in California, but it's provided by individuals, not power companies. | tensor([ 4.6971, -5.8343])

While historically the use of the semicolon and colon were similar, modern usage seems to be diverging, with semicolons indicating breaks slightly stronger than commas and colons introducing lists and explanations. | tensor([ 4.3895, -5.6838])
\nSemicolons have always been used in a manner very similar to commas, but with greater "weight." | tensor([ 4.6767, -5.8470])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
That is, the semicolon introduces greater breaks in the sentence, dividing clauses which are longer and more independent, while commas are reserved for short pauses and for separating lists of short items.\nContinuing up the continuum, colons are "weightier" than semicolons, but less so than periods. | tensor([ 4.6841, -5.8764])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
They introduce a break which is longer or more important than that introduced by semicolons, but not as final as periods. | tensor([ 4.3697, -5.6327])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Colons separate clauses which can stand as independent sentences grammatically, while semicolons can also be used for non-sentential clauses.\nHowever, in modern writing the colon is rarely used in this role as glorified semicolon. | tensor([ 4.7355, -5.8007])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The colon has developed a specific semantics as a break separating an introduction from an explanation. | tensor([ 4.4805, -5.7165])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
For example, the colon is used after the salutation in formal letters. | tensor([ 4.4983, -5.7690])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It is used to introduce quotes, separating the source from the quoted text. | tensor([ 4.3486, -5.6315])

Dogs with curved tails are known to be chasing flies and fleas that got on their tails. | tensor([ 2.1073, -2.0777])
Owners of the dogs found this a nuisance that all of a sudden a dog would keep chasing its tail for several hours in a week. | tensor([ 2.4415, -2.3756])
Due to this dogs forgot their "job" which was to guard sheep, or pull carts, etc.\nSecondly, certain dogs go very wild if we pull their tails, even if its done playfully. | tensor([ 2.0536, -1.9686])
They simply get mad at you, bite you or even kill you, if you are small. | tensor([-3.1403,  3.1442])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])

Found an interesting article on this...\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. | tensor([ 4.6815, -5.7005])
During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. | tensor([ 4.5231, -5.4766])
These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. | tensor([ 2.2284, -2.1500])

During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. | tensor([ 4.7446, -5.7915])
We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. | tensor([ 2.9882, -3.0627])
The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. | tensor([ 3.0310, -3.1747])
This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. | tensor([ 4.5900, -5.7772])
Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. | tensor([ 4.2916, -5.1888])

From my personal experience, I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects. | tensor([ 4.6879, -5.9077])

Her sister was expected to do chores, take care of the family etc. | tensor([ 4.7610, -5.8134])
She ended up being the dependable, reliable one because she developed her independence. | tensor([ 4.7485, -5.7928])
She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. | tensor([ 4.1814, -4.9493])

Plato quoted it:\n\n"Remember how in that communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may."\n\nN.B.: "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." | tensor([ 4.2768, -5.1077])
- The bowls came first and have to be dislodged\n\n- The bowl organizers control larges amounts of money. | tensor([ 4.4355, -5.2929])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Some of these monies are given to participating universities and their conferences. | tensor([ 4.4870, -5.7308])
Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. | tensor([ 4.5777, -5.5673])
And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. | tensor([ 4.6846, -5.8850])
Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\n\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year. | tensor([ 4.1073, -4.7693])

Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing.   | tensor([ 4.6272, -5.7271])
Also due the physical nature of the game, players need several days to recovery. | tensor([ 4.6590, -5.8662])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This limits games to about one every 5 days or so (about one a week). | tensor([ 4.1828, -5.4785])

Can't answer your question exactly, but it looks an awful lot like a Gibson archtop or a Gretsch.   | tensor([ 4.4532, -5.3174])
You can poke around either of their websites to see guitars that look pretty similar to the one in the picture. | tensor([ 4.5625, -5.7966])

Gretsch calls it a "chromatic tailpiece". | tensor([ 4.4417, -5.3704])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\n\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious "soapbar" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then). | tensor([ 4.6113, -5.8576])

The Trek 1000 was about $900 CDN. | tensor([ 4.5486, -5.5823])
The only difference in the bikes up to the $1500 range is the shifters are usually a little better (they don't stretch as easily, which makes shifting cleaner for longer). | tensor([ 4.6184, -5.8092])
The weight and wheels are basically the same. | tensor([ 4.3140, -5.6537])

While it is true that Eric Dickerson holds the single season *total* rushing yards record, he accomplished this in a 16-game season. | tensor([ 4.4969, -5.8086])
On the other hand, O.J. Simpson is the only player in NFL history to break the 2,000 yard barrier in a single 14-game season. | tensor([ 4.5883, -5.8386])
O.J. Simpson gained 143 yards per game in his record-breaking season, while Dickerson only gained 131 yards per game in his. | tensor([ 4.6127, -5.7528])

The earliest form of currency used was large stones that could be used to get food and meat in exchange - this was during the stone age. | tensor([ 4.5614, -5.5418])
Before this there was a barter of goods (so i am not considering it currency)\nLarge stones which were round were considered more valuable since they were more difficult to obtain\n\nThe first recorded accounts of currency date back to 2000 BCE and silver or metal tokens were used to represent a stored value of grain. | tensor([ 4.7068, -5.7729])
Also these were useful to ensure that a shipment of commodities arrived with the same goods that were shipped\n\nPaper money was used in the 18th century, but only in the late 18th and through the 19th century was a central monetary authority created in various states that had a virtual monopoly of creating bank-notes that had to be accepted as legal tender everywhere (Prior to this, the one accepting payments could refuse the payment if it was not in a currency which  had been predetermined before the loan or in general use: | tensor([ 4.6816, -5.7610])

Materials that form an inverse energy distribution? | tensor([ 4.4648, -5.7684])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Not quite.\n\nThere are three basic components for getting a laser to work. | tensor([ 4.5169, -5.4783])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
First, one needs an excitation source (pumping source) such as a flashlamp, an electrical spark, etc.   | tensor([ 4.4840, -5.7396])
Second, one needs a material (the gain medium) which can exhibit what's known as population inversion - the capacity for a material to raise the electron energy level from the lower to the upper energy states. | tensor([ 4.5025, -5.7687])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others. | tensor([ 4.5565, -5.7924])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Finally, one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator.\n\nThere are many combinations of pump sources, lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use. | tensor([ 4.5855, -5.6976])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])

Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. | tensor([ 4.7454, -5.8509])
The role of a programming language can be described in two ways:\n\n   1. | tensor([ 4.5570, -5.8124])
It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks\n   2. | tensor([ 4.7207, -5.8300])
Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes. | tensor([ 4.4475, -5.7097])
\n\nAccording to the last statement, in programming we deal with two kind of things:\n\n    * data, representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate\n    * procedures, i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data. | tensor([ 4.6390, -5.7021])
\n\nAccording to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON, 1985, 4,])\n\n    ``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. | tensor([ 4.6549, -5.7392])
Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n\n    primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned\n\n    means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and\n\n    means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units. | tensor([ 4.4986, -5.7736])

Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. | tensor([ 4.5619, -5.8381])
When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn "incentivizes" people to answer questions. | tensor([ 4.6658, -5.8745])
And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased.\n\nSee my answer to the question, "Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?":\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767\n\nOn the issue of the term "incentivize"--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process. | tensor([ 3.8688, -4.4174])

The basic answer is indie (or independent) music is music that is released on smaller labels that operate independently from the mainstream music business.\n\nBut more often "indie" refers to a specific genre of contemporary music that is based on combining aesthetics of classic rock, punk, garage and art rock. | tensor([ 4.7052, -5.8169])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])

Folksonomy is a word formed from a combination of "folk" and "taxonomy". | tensor([ 4.6357, -5.8499])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It's a recently developed concept of the general public categorizing information according to what's most useful for the masses, and is considered in opposition to the sometimes more formal classification systems created by an entity such as the Library of Congress or Yahoo!.\n\nFolksonomies are often implemented using tags.   | tensor([ 4.6535, -5.8743])
An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item, rather than having to decide which category to place the item in. | tensor([ 4.5345, -5.8094])
Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. | tensor([ 4.5655, -5.4879])
It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or "snoop" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or "inject" unwelcome traffic as well. | tensor([ 4.6551, -5.8415])
However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. | tensor([ 4.5853, -5.8407])
For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. | tensor([ 4.6396, -5.8525])
Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. | tensor([ 4.5812, -5.7640])
Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. | tensor([ 4.6633, -5.8704])
The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now "secure enough" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. | tensor([ 4.6997, -5.7981])
Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or "encrypt" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. | tensor([ 4.6271, -5.7655])
Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. | tensor([ 4.6693, -5.8306])
The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. | tensor([ 4.6913, -5.8629])

It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). | tensor([ 4.6747, -5.8502])
But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship.\n\nAccording to a 1986 survey, more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. | tensor([ 4.5608, -5.4358])
(Huling-Austin, 1986).\n\nThese are some factors likely most likely to affect the attrition of new teachers:\n\n1) | tensor([ 4.6873, -5.8360])
Beginning teachers are unable to cope with teaching problems like discipline, difficulties with parents, and lack of sufficient or appropriate teaching materials.\n\n2) | tensor([ 4.6042, -5.5181])
Beginners are often given the most difficult teaching assignments. | tensor([ 4.6088, -5.8249])
\n\n3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching.\n\nOther factors, such as salary, affect attrition rates, but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies. | tensor([ 4.3072, -5.0959])

I have been taking a class called "Core Fusion" for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt). | tensor([ 2.2597, -2.1521])

Evolution is ever-present as always. | tensor([ 4.6787, -5.8517])
You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. | tensor([ 4.5640, -5.7934])
So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. | tensor([ 4.4637, -5.7629])
Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. | tensor([ 4.6829, -5.8468])
As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. | tensor([ 4.2832, -5.1449])
So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. | tensor([ 4.5652, -5.5284])
Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\n\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\n\nIs average height an example of this? | tensor([ 3.5484, -3.9370])

The housing market around here is absolutely insane. | tensor([ 2.1579, -2.0524])
At the point you have a job offer, you are in the best position to negotiate. | tensor([ 4.7399, -5.8623])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process, and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position. | tensor([ 4.6890, -5.8804])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected, and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests.\n\nThe other factor is the overall job market. | tensor([ 4.6788, -5.7187])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
In today's market, where employment is picking up in many sectors you're in a good spot to negotiate.\n\nNow the right place to phrase things is to describe competitive offers (hopefully you'll have some) in terms of their relative advantage. | tensor([ 4.7344, -5.8865])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
If one of your alternative offers pays more, you can allude to this vaguely. | tensor([ 4.6181, -5.8305])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Even if they do not, you can allude to the relative advantages (the types of challenge, the convience of the commute etc). | tensor([ 4.5183, -5.7854])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash).\n\nUnless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area), you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%. | tensor([ 3.5032, -3.9848])
 Put this out there with clear timelines for when they need to respond, and other forms you might accept (signing bonus, trading-up level/rank, etc).\n\nYou should stay professional throughout the process, even if your offer is rejected. | tensor([ 4.6949, -5.8872])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Employers know that this is the right time to bring these things up, so don't worry about burning bridges by putting a request out there at this stage.\n\nOk. | tensor([ 4.2945, -5.1026])

It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). | tensor([ 4.5273, -5.8199])
Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. | tensor([ 4.6072, -5.8753])
At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. | tensor([ 4.5195, -5.8100])
This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. | tensor([ 4.5493, -5.7882])
Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. | tensor([ 4.4953, -5.8016])
The best article I've read on the subject is in the link below.   | tensor([ 4.4454, -5.7030])
In summary, the article cites the following 7 factors common to Web 2.0:\n\n* Services, not packaged software, with cost-effective scalability\n* Control over unique, hard-to-recreate data sources that get richer as more people use them\n* Trusting users as co-developers\n* Harnessing collective intelligence\n* Leveraging the long tail through customer self-service\n* Software above the level of | tensor([ 4.6814, -5.7485])
a single device\n* Lightweight user interfaces, development models, AND business models | tensor([ 4.6965, -5.6820])
IMHO, the A's will be traded Zito this off-season or in the middle of next season. | tensor([ 4.5798, -5.8789])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The "Money-ball" philosophy has been working for them and they will continue. | tensor([ 4.6824, -5.8721])
 Trading Zito will also get them some good young players too. | tensor([ 4.6616, -5.7722])
I'd say yes, all high schools should offer SAT test prep. | tensor([ 4.6766, -5.7240])
The main two reasons:\n\n1) | tensor([ 4.6399, -5.6969])
Workers 18 and over with a bachelor’s degree earn an average of $51,206 a year, while those with a high school diploma earn $27,915. | tensor([ 4.4315, -5.4689])
(U.S. Census Bureau). | tensor([ 4.3621, -5.6792])
\n\nBasically, college grads earn twice as much money as high school grads. | tensor([ 3.3867, -3.7347])
This increased income provides more security, support to raise a family, and the means for furthering ones education.\n\n2) College grads have access to better jobs as many jobs require a college degree. | tensor([ 4.4791, -5.3806])
The Corleones are more powerful, hands down.\n\nand for one reason, alone: The Sopranos don't have the muscle to take out the heads of all five crime families in one swoop and live to tell about it, including the big man in Vegas and take over his operation. | tensor([ 3.6658, -4.1723])
The Corleons are a much bigger organization with a wider network.\n\nHead to head war, \nCorleones (GF1) vs. Sopranos (S1):\nVito (or Michael) Corleone vs. Tony Soprano\nSonny vs. Christopher\nClemenza vs. Silvio\nTessio vs. Paulie\nFredo vs. Big Pussy\nBarzini vs. Junior\nand Kay vs. Carmela :-) | tensor([ 2.6977, -2.5695])
As a dutchman, and someone who's 6'4" I should be able to answer this one.\n\nSpecifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this, the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being "the tallest nation in the world".\n\nThe average dutchman is about 6'1" (4" taller than the avg american)\n\nResearch shows it to be a combo of genetics, disease prevention, diet (dairy, etc.) , average wealth & wellbeing, as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height.\n\nSo to summarize: drink your milk, get your shots, be happy and grow grow grow.. | tensor([ 3.6274, -4.1139])
oh and a bit of genetics.\n\nFrom a research report:\n\nGenetic factors are evident in marked regional differences between the north and the south of the Netherlands. | tensor([ 4.4524, -5.2833])
In the north, boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. | tensor([ 4.1609, -4.8091])
The populations are relatively stable, and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian, whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. | tensor([ 4.7078, -5.8148])
However, although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch, they are taller than in their countries of origin. | tensor([ 4.1599, -4.8602])
Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch, the world's highest consumers of dairy products. | tensor([ 4.5875, -5.5726])
Fredriks, one of the researchers in the recent study, emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example, the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children.\n\nLastly it's the healthcare system and wealth, every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. | tensor([ 4.4472, -5.3052])
It's been shown that wealth has a direct impact on height.. | tensor([ 4.5518, -5.8159])

Should Nolan Schaefer get a shot? | tensor([ 4.7003, -5.8514])
\n\nNabokov should be given a chance to rest, start Nolan for a couple of games and then get him back in there. | tensor([ 4.3686, -5.1774])
I believe he will be able to snap out of this funk, but trading him now would be the absolute worst time for them to trade him in terms of what they could get in return. | tensor([ 4.0249, -4.7493])
There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. | tensor([ 4.6599, -5.8348])
Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. | tensor([ 4.5587, -5.7158])
But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. | tensor([ 4.5231, -5.7752])
What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. | tensor([ 4.7154, -5.8691])
He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. | tensor([ 4.6456, -5.8797])
His theory is contraversial, but it's worth a try. | tensor([ 4.6645, -5.8557])
You may want to test that theory. | tensor([ 4.5324, -5.7675])
\n\nThe program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. | tensor([ 4.1535, -4.7800])
It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster. | tensor([ 4.6484, -5.6340])
\n\nOne theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth, like grinding sound of moving rocks. | tensor([ 3.7004, -4.2445])
\n\nAnyway, you'll find some interesting programs on PBS stations. | tensor([ 4.7215, -5.7383])

It is a nice touch, even in a casual workplace, to get the business cards of people you interview with, and send them a quick email thank you note. | tensor([ 4.7057, -5.8740])
Although it will not sway the decision of that particular job, if there's another job that the person knows about, they will remember you and have your email in their inbox to contact you about it. | tensor([ 4.7077, -5.8987])

Likely locks for the West include San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, Denver, Seattle. | tensor([ 4.4544, -5.7411])
Which leaves the Warriors battling for the last 2 spots against LAL, Memphis and Sacramento - all of which are better teams. | tensor([ 4.5485, -5.8389])
Most onboard video for PC desktop motherboards are far short of performance for even a PCI-only card. | tensor([ 4.5989, -5.6187])

For the Intel 845 chipset, having a dedicated PCI video card can definitely improve your performance, especially for 3D games. | tensor([ 4.3939, -5.7352])
There are a number of different DHCP clients that run on Linux. | tensor([ 4.4097, -5.7303])

Look to /etc/dhcpc for any files that might be there.\n\nPUMP is also a frequent program in use by some versions of RedHat Linux. | tensor([ 4.7148, -5.8254])
 Run "pump -i eth0 --status" assuming your ethernet interface is eth0\n\nDHCLIENT -- run "locate dhclient.leases" and look into that file if you see that process running. | tensor([ 4.3020, -5.0729])

Permutation\nSuppose we want to find the number of ways to arrange the three letters in the word CAT in different two-letter groups where CA is different from AC and there are no repeated letters.\n\nBecause order matters, we're finding the number of permutations of size 2 that can be taken from a set of size 3. | tensor([ 4.6320, -5.8524])
This is often written 3_P_2. | tensor([ 4.6738, -5.8179])
We can list them as:\n\n      CA   CT   AC   AT    | tensor([ 4.6495, -5.6602])
TC   TA\n\nCombination\nWhen we want to find the number of combinations of size 2 without repeated letters that can be made from the three letters in the word CAT, order doesn't matter; AT is the same as TA. | tensor([ 4.6599, -5.6310])
We can write out the three combinations of size two that can be taken from this set of size three:\n\n      CA   CT   AT | tensor([ 4.6818, -5.8507])
Dating from the 1920's the expression buck naked commonly means completely or totally naked or without a "stitch" (as opposed to partially naked). | tensor([ 1.7605, -1.7135])
Synonyms include "bare naked", "buck-arse naked", and "butt naked" (also spelled, facetiously, "butt nekkid"). | tensor([-2.7360,  2.6681])
In the South, "buck naked" or "butt naked" means not in your house, out looking for trouble on Saturday night and wearing no clothes. | tensor([-1.4477,  1.3313])
the last (2004) FIFA best player of the world is Ronaldinho (playing at barcelona, don't confuse with Ronaldo, playing at Real Madrid). | tensor([ 4.6445, -5.7856])
Read the official FIFA interview with him at http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/gala.html\n\nAlso, TODAY (november 28, 2005), Ronaldinho is going to receive the "Ballon D'Or" (golden ball), prize created by the french magazine French Football --http://www.francefootball.fr/ -- in 1956 to distinguish the best player of the european leagues. | tensor([ 4.7561, -5.8138])
The complete list of winners of this prize is at: http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/ballon_or/index_bo.html\n\nNow, the general audience... | tensor([ 4.7711, -5.8812])
this is tough, since there are many players that could be the best at any time (henry, lampard, ronaldo, ronaldinho, zidane -getting older, though-, kaká, eto'o, ...). | tensor([ 4.6260, -5.7823])
But truth is that, at this moment of the season, Ronaldinho is one step above the rest, and playing in the current best team (barcelona) helps him a lot. | tensor([ 4.6901, -5.7670])
Well... being that people get 'points' for answering questions, I'm sure there will be a lot of 'filler' questions going into this one, so I'd guess you'll get 50 in here, but about 4 or 5 on average. | tensor([ 4.5922, -5.8603])

Depends on your teeth. | tensor([ 3.3397, -3.8182])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
I used Crest Whitestrips for a time, and they worked really well (I definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth).   | tensor([ 4.6334, -5.8205])
However, they irritated my gums to the point where my dentist told me to stop using them and they made my teeth super sensitive to cold and hot (i.e. eating ice cream or drinking tea was painful). | tensor([ 2.5987, -2.6360])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
I've never done the laser whitening/Brite Smile, but I've seen those treatments work wonders for folks who have (they are not cheap though). | tensor([ 4.6129, -5.8336])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
I would advise trying the strips (making sure to abide by the time guidelines) - you will like the effects of them (they do really work) and if they don't bother your teeth/gums, you should be able to continue use. | tensor([ 4.6262, -5.6763])
Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:\n\nWhen you think a stock is going to go down... | tensor([ 4.4271, -5.2606])
You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker.\n2. | tensor([ 4.3742, -5.1802])
You sell those shares at today's price.\n3. | tensor([ 3.6771, -4.2186])
You wait for the stock to go down.\n4. | tensor([ 3.0034, -3.0882])
You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.\n5. | tensor([ 3.9192, -4.5400])
You return the borrowed shares.\n6. | tensor([ 4.0915, -4.7793])
You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.\nSteps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.\n\nThe advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down. | tensor([ 4.6173, -5.6181])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
(With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)\n\nThe disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money. | tensor([ 4.2148, -4.9798])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment. | tensor([ 4.7127, -5.8955])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
(With a regular stock purchase, the most you can lose is the amount you originally invested.) | tensor([ 4.6862, -5.8636])
There are several means of successfully treating malaria if contracted, yet malaria is still one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developing world. | tensor([ 4.6918, -5.7806])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The reason is that most of these people are too poor to afford even basic preventative measures like bednets (which keeps malarial misquitoes from biting children in their sleep).\n\nBednets are important step to reducing the impact of malaria, because it is much more expensive to treat malaria once it is contracted than it is to prevent it via bednets, removing standing water, etc.\n\nThere are some efforts to find cheaper alternative treatments as well, including one promising one that comes from Chinese herbal medicine. | tensor([ 2.9745, -3.1123])
\n\nhttp://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/11/26/health.malaria/\n\nI've also attached a CDC (center for disease control) article that describes some of the anti-malarial drugs currently being used. | tensor([ 4.7234, -5.7413])

Dinosaurs laid eggs millions of years ago.\n2. | tensor([ 4.6731, -5.7604])
 Chickens weren't around millions of years ago.\n3. | tensor([ 2.4130, -2.3864])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Therefore, eggs came first.\n4. | tensor([ 4.5668, -5.4527])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Later, egg-laying birds evolved into chickens. | tensor([ 3.8352, -4.4554])

Of course, this will only work if you don't mind non-person to person tutoring.\n\nI would contact your local high schools and see if there are any tutors that will tutor your kid. | tensor([ 2.9155, -2.9942])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It might help both the high school student (elective credit) and your kid (because young kids look up to high school students).\n\nNewspapers are always advertising people looking for work such as nannies, care-takers, and yes...even tutors.\n\nI would try the high schools first.\n\nHere are a list of tutorint centers in the Portland area:\nhttp://www.anysubject.com/portland-tutors.asp\nhttp://portland.craigslist.com/lss/\nhttp://www.mindsinmotiontutoring.com/ | tensor([ 3.9875, -4.5916])

The Sarbanes-Oxley act was sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley, and is a response to the auditing scandals surrounding Enron, WorldCom, and others.   | tensor([ 4.4737, -5.7731])
Essentially it aims to protect investors by requiring public companies to adhere to certain standards around auditor independence, information integrity, and greater financial disclosure.\n\nFrom an IT perspective S-Ox compliance revolves around preserving information and ensuring that the systems that maintain financial records are capturing all the correct data. | tensor([ 4.6830, -5.9027])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Of course, S-Ox compliance can be rather complex and counterintuitive, so there are plenty of consultants who earn a living by making companies S-Ox compliant, as it is a requirement for all public companies. | tensor([ 4.6976, -5.8137])

Take Care, Love and Light | tensor([ 4.6263, -5.5743])
The difference is the level of commitment. | tensor([ 4.4367, -5.7478])
"Dating" connotes a casual thing, not necessarily exclusive. | tensor([ 4.6251, -5.8520])
When a person says "I'm dating Bill" instead of "Bill is my boyfriend", you can probably guess the relationship is relatively new and no commitment has been made. | tensor([ 4.6849, -5.8864])
\nWhen you've decided you're in a relationship, you'll probably start referring to one another as boyfriend/girlfriend. | tensor([ 4.1958, -4.8793])
You'll introduce each other to your close friends and family. | tensor([ 4.7005, -5.8347])
You'll likely spend a LOT of time together, and may take it for granted that you'll see each other certain nights and weekends. | tensor([ 4.7077, -5.8668])
Depending on your lifestyle, you may agree to make your relationship exclusive and stop seeing other people.\nIf you're uncomfortable discussing taking things to "the next level" you're probably just dating, and not quite ready for a relationship. | tensor([ 4.1104, -4.7604])

Another reason is that the P.M.'s responses are scripted in advance, where at all possible.   | tensor([ 4.4392, -5.7175])
Questions from the House--especially from the opposition--are designed to get him off his game and distract him from the prepared text, in the hope of making him look bad. | tensor([ 4.7214, -5.7980])

  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])

According to this page in the French wikipedia, Reinhard comes from Regin + Hard (strong advice as you mention)\n\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Renart\n\nInterestingly, the page goes on to say that the word "renard" (French for "fox") comes from Reinhard! | tensor([ 4.4989, -5.3702])
Reinhard was the name of the fox (originally "goupil" in French) in a famous story "Reynard the fox", but due to the popularity of the fox character, the French name for fox became "renard" instead of "goupil".\n\n"Reinhard  : Voir Renard pour le sens. | tensor([ 4.4117, -5.2098])

Answers to this question can vary greatly, but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation.   | tensor([ 4.3363, -5.6568])
Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets. | tensor([ 4.3386, -5.6692])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\n\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high. | tensor([ 4.6756, -5.7859])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming. | tensor([ 4.4952, -5.7698])
 Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.\n\nIt's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself. | tensor([ 4.6746, -5.7979])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\n\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\n\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\n\nwhere | tensor([ 4.6780, -5.6953])
N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year. | tensor([ 4.6293, -5.8529])
 \n\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\n\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\n\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year. | tensor([ 4.5840, -5.5640])

  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
When I rewrote it this time, I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me. | tensor([ 4.7072, -5.8821])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Instead, I wrote a profile that reflected exactly how I felt and who I was at that moment.\n\nAnd then, I started to meet interesting people.   | tensor([ 4.7211, -5.8669])
Shortly thereafter, I met my bf and things have been going well since. | tensor([ 4.5165, -5.2985])

The 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. | tensor([ 4.5909, -5.7610])
These pandemics killed scores of people. | tensor([ 2.5509, -2.6278])
The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. | tensor([ 4.1690, -4.8672])
Like last year, vaccines for "regular" human flu are in short supply as well.\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you're just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. | tensor([ 3.5001, -3.8684])
When the flu strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them. | tensor([ 1.6016, -1.8451])
To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the "implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention".\n\nIn other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. \n\nEach learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. | tensor([ 4.2417, -5.0475])
And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. | tensor([ 4.6721, -5.8762])
\n\nThe NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student.\n\nOne of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. | tensor([ 4.4166, -5.1967])
This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. | tensor([ 4.5808, -5.8250])

hi,\n\nThis question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. | tensor([ 4.7330, -5.7444])
I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. | tensor([ 4.6503, -5.8491])
To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. | tensor([ 4.6292, -5.8266])
\n\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\n\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\n\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. | tensor([ 4.5897, -5.5063])
it's not suprising. | tensor([ 4.4383, -5.7007])
they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. | tensor([ 4.6826, -5.6952])
that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\n\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. | tensor([ 4.7278, -5.8806])
this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. | tensor([ 4.5342, -5.8018])
one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. | tensor([ 4.7206, -5.8524])
a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\n\n4) accountability- | tensor([ 4.7626, -5.8102])
it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. | tensor([ 4.7635, -5.8504])
while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. | tensor([ 4.6139, -5.8481])
it's not. | tensor([ 4.6135, -5.7661])
the other factors are equally important, if not more so. | tensor([ 4.4375, -5.6894])
to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\n\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\n\nhope this helps? | tensor([ 4.3371, -5.1038])
Generally, film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious, but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes, too.\n\nNotorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. | tensor([ 4.6465, -5.8322])

The sky is blue due to atmospheric scattering of blue light. | tensor([ 4.5005, -5.7937])
Blue photons are the most energetic of the visible light photos, and interact more with the atmosphere as a result. | tensor([ 4.4943, -5.5591])

110 Volts is nominal and may vary when measured by a voltmeter. | tensor([ 4.3778, -5.6714])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles. | tensor([ 4.5184, -5.7811])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The very high voltage there is stepped down using a transformer to supply most houses and businesses with a usable lower voltage. | tensor([ 4.5476, -5.7382])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb. | tensor([ 4.5557, -5.6622])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range. | tensor([ 4.4959, -5.6862])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Houses do not use all three wires. | tensor([ 4.5980, -5.6496])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.   | tensor([ 4.5515, -5.5823])
Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits. | tensor([ 4.3049, -5.6253])
 Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention. | tensor([ 4.5104, -5.7757])

Reverse swing is an art invented by former Pakistani fast bowler Sarfaraz Nawaz, followed by Imran Khan, Waseem Akram and Waqar Younis.\n\nA new cricket ball has shine on both sides. | tensor([ 4.1311, -4.8492])
When the ball gets older the shine disappears and the amount of swing is decreased. | tensor([ 4.5702, -5.5923])
In reverse swing the bowler keeps one side of the ball shining and one rough.\nDue to air friction the rough side resists the air and the ball moves towards the shining side having less friction on that side.\nSo it will allways move towards the direction of the shine.\nWaqar younis had the habbit of hiding the ball from batsman before its delivery. | tensor([ 3.6554, -4.0927])

\n\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. | tensor([ 3.5854, -4.0311])

The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. | tensor([ 3.3792, -3.8421])
So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. | tensor([ 3.5034, -4.0667])

The origin of the popular Christmas colors red and green is speculated to be Italy, since the Italian flag's colors are red, green, and white and most of the Christmas traditions we have were usurped from early Pagan people of the 3rd Century.\n\nIn AD 274, Emperor Aurelian decreed December 25 as natalis solis invicti ("birth of the invincible sun"), a festival honoring the sun god | tensor([ 4.5643, -5.5899])

You can use of of the many php MVC Framework. | tensor([ 4.6309, -5.8787])
One of the most used one is phpMVC. | tensor([ 4.4459, -5.6400])
\n\nQuoted from their website "php. | tensor([ 4.6475, -5.5768])
MVC implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, and encourages application design based on the Model 2 paradigm. | tensor([ 4.3562, -5.6535])
This design model allows the Web page or other contents (View) to be mostly separated from the internal application code (Controller/Model), making it easier for designers and programmers to focus on their respective areas of expertise.\n\nThe framework provides a single entry point Controller. | tensor([ 4.6313, -5.8738])
The Controller is responsible for allocating HTTP requests to the appropriate Action handler (Model) based on configuration mappings.\n\nThe Model contains the business logic for the application. | tensor([ 4.6611, -5.8762])
The Controller then forwards the request to the appropriate View component, which is usually implemented using a combination of HTML with PHP tags in the form of templates. | tensor([ 4.4573, -5.7633])
The resulting contents are returned to the client browser, or via another protocol such as SMTP.\n\nphp. | tensor([ 4.6951, -5.8915])

"Phishing" generally refers to those e-mail messages that say they're from a bank (or eBay or PayPal or your ISP), but the links actually go to some other web site where the phisher (still pretending to be a bank) asks for your information, and will use it to steal your identity, money, etcetera.\n\n"Pharming" is another twist on the same thing, using more devious tricks. | tensor([ 3.6188, -4.0775])

As you may know, NQSO (non qualifying stock options) have tax withheld at source as soon as you exercise, so theoretically you don't have to pay any estimated tax on NQSO exercises/sales (although see * below).\n\nWith Incentive Stock Options (ISO) though, the situation is quite different.\n\nIt sounds like you plan to exercise and sell your ISOs on the same day. | tensor([ 4.7349, -5.8725])

In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price). | tensor([ 4.6521, -5.8947])

  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])

  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\n\n\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return. | tensor([ 4.4949, -5.3972])

Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000). | tensor([ 4.6248, -5.8604])

\n\n2.   | tensor([ 3.6728, -4.1264])
Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\n\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\n\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\n\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill. | tensor([ 4.4973, -5.4279])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\n\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000. | tensor([ 4.5834, -5.5513])
   | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\n\n\n\nClear? | tensor([ 4.1782, -4.8830])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
As mud?\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\n\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%). | tensor([ 3.4204, -3.8118])
 \n\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.   | tensor([ 2.2982, -2.1925])

Hitchcock directed, produced and wrote some of the greatest suspense films of all time. | tensor([ 4.1271, -4.9296])
His career spanned from the 1920's to the 1970's. | tensor([ 4.1236, -5.3913])

Direct quote from http://www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm: "To be somewhere with "bells on" refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares. | tensor([ 4.7139, -5.8402])

The main advantage is that the compact crankset gearing is much closer to the high cadence riding that is the current trend in modern cycling. | tensor([ 4.5636, -5.7241])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.   | tensor([ 4.5413, -5.6681])
The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.   | tensor([ 3.5114, -3.9940])
The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\n\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.   | tensor([ 3.8328, -4.4607])
The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\n\nA couple things to consider, though.   | tensor([ 4.5313, -5.4893])

Stock option grants and stock grants are two forms of compensation often offered as incentives in addition to base salary offered to a newly hired employee. | tensor([ 4.5273, -5.8374])
This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. | tensor([ 4.5015, -5.7892])
\n\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. | tensor([ 4.5969, -5.6190])
The set price is called the strike price. | tensor([ 4.4845, -5.7245])
When you (the stock option holder) make use of your right to buy/sell stock according to the terms of the option, you are exercising the option. | tensor([ 4.6116, -5.8663])
Call options are options giving you the right to buy stock. | tensor([ 4.6196, -5.8671])
Put options are options giving you the right to sell stock. | tensor([ 4.7137, -5.8688])
Employers grant call options to employees. | tensor([ 4.7208, -5.9075])
Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. | tensor([ 4.6257, -5.8757])
This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. | tensor([ 4.6335, -5.8883])
Let's say it's after four years now. | tensor([ 4.5484, -5.7956])
Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. | tensor([ 3.1518, -3.6424])
Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. | tensor([ 4.7042, -5.8050])
Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. | tensor([ 4.5714, -5.5494])
So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. | tensor([ 4.6914, -5.8209])
But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\n\nStock grants are simpler to understand. | tensor([ 4.7262, -5.8752])
The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. | tensor([ 4.7565, -5.8045])
So let's use the Google example again. | tensor([ 4.5782, -5.8396])
Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. | tensor([ 4.6576, -5.6697])
Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. | tensor([ 4.6171, -5.5835])
At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\n\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. | tensor([ 4.6501, -5.8727])
That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. | tensor([ 4.7211, -5.8890])
A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. | tensor([ 4.4654, -5.7378])
This is done to give employees an incentive to stay at the company. | tensor([ 4.7095, -5.8360])

The predatory mammals (which includes us humans) -- flesh-eating hunters such as the cats the dogs, wolves and foxes; the bears; and the weasel family -- have binocular vision: eyes in the front of their heads, with powerful eye muscles that enable them to focus very rapidly and to contract or dilate the pupils according to whether the light is bright or dim. | tensor([ 3.1322, -3.2528])

Going out to eat is traditionally what is done on an anniversary, but I prefer one on one time where there is nobody else around. | tensor([ 4.6905, -5.7090])
No strangers talking loudly, no waiters to interrupt, no time wasted in line or in the car. | tensor([ 4.0915, -4.7563])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
\n\nIn my opinion, Anniversaries are about each other, and to do that, you've gotta block out the rest of the world.   | tensor([ 3.5973, -4.0724])
Here's my recipe for a fabulous anniversary. | tensor([ 4.7342, -5.7696])
FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. | tensor([ 1.8087, -1.6659])
I'll tell you why in a little bit.\n\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). | tensor([ 4.6305, -5.6005])
Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles. | tensor([ 4.0036, -4.7391])
 Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\n\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. | tensor([ 4.4756, -5.3493])
Knee to knee, and eye to eye. | tensor([ 2.8921, -2.9640])
Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. | tensor([ 3.0963, -3.1596])
Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. | tensor([ 4.5107, -5.7949])
Before you know it, hours will have passed. | tensor([ 4.6838, -5.6612])
Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. | tensor([ 3.7328, -4.2263])
You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. | tensor([ 2.6733, -2.6823])
\n\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. | tensor([ 2.9165, -2.9011])
How they make you feel, and why you love them. | tensor([ 4.5979, -5.5713])
Why you appreciate them. | tensor([ 4.7149, -5.8469])
The more specific you get the better. | tensor([ 4.5757, -5.8143])
For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. | tensor([ 3.3411, -3.6562])
Now don't let the other person read it. | tensor([ 4.4941, -5.3371])
Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. | tensor([ 4.7580, -5.8531])
It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. | tensor([ 4.6871, -5.7699])
\n\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\n\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\n\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think? | tensor([ 2.6407, -2.5181])

Well, search engines like Yahoo! | tensor([ 4.7271, -5.8313])
and Google try to be something like that | tensor([ 4.6307, -5.8652])
but, of course, they can only be approximate. | tensor([ 4.4615, -5.7036])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
There are a number of problems with indexing EVERYTHING on the web:\n\na) | tensor([ 4.4332, -5.2770])

  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
New web pages do not have to pass through any central controlling authority. | tensor([ 4.5589, -5.7954])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
How would an indexer/table-of-contents-compiler know what to add? | tensor([ 4.5254, -5.7737])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The best that the search engines can do is something called "crawling" the web, looking for new pages.\n\nc) | tensor([ 4.7110, -5.8780])
Some people don't WANT the rest of the world to know about their web pages. | tensor([ 3.7996, -4.3747])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
They just want a few people -- maybe just friends and family -- to be able to find the pages easily. | tensor([ 4.6873, -5.8786])
Part One\n(revised | tensor([ 4.6123, -5.8390])
This is a single part of what will be, by my classification, about 240 compact tribal histories (contact to 1900). | tensor([ 4.3927, -5.6873])
It is limited to the lower 48 states of the U.S. but also includes those First Nations from Canada and Mexico that had important roles (Huron, Micmac, Assiniboine, etc.).\n\nAlthough this Cherokee history is larger than most, it's content and style are representative. | tensor([ 4.6710, -5.8378])
The normal process at this point is to circulate an almost finished product among a peer group for comment and criticism.\n\nUsing the Internet, this can be more inclusive. | tensor([ 4.7413, -5.8800])
Feel free to comment or suggest corrections via e-mail. | tensor([ 4.6483, -5.8641])
Working together we can end some of the historical misinformation about Native Americans. | tensor([ 4.6951, -5.8595])
You will find the ego at this end is standard size. | tensor([ 4.0145, -4.6803])

I look forward to your comments... | tensor([ 4.7410, -5.8825])

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. | tensor([ 4.7111, -5.9106])
The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. | tensor([ 4.6844, -5.8961])
Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\n\nPopulation\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. | tensor([ 4.4869, -5.4000])
How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. | tensor([ 4.4956, -5.5054])
A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. | tensor([ 4.5317, -5.5686])
The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. | tensor([ 2.7321, -2.9808])
No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. | tensor([ 4.1766, -4.9567])
The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. | tensor([ 4.3693, -5.3104])
Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. | tensor([ 4.5806, -5.7996])
Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\n\n\nName\nThe | tensor([ 4.6054, -5.6114])
most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word "Chelokee" meaning "people of a different speech. | tensor([ 4.7229, -5.8343])
" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) "principal people" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) "people of Kituhwa. | tensor([ 4.6705, -5.8715])
" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). | tensor([ 4.6330, -5.8556])
Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\n\n\nLanguage\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\n\n\nSub-tribes\n\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \nLower | tensor([ 4.5174, -5.6629])

Massage therapy has been proven to be an efffective alternative relief for Lupus people suffering from Lupus.\n\nMassage is believed to be beneficial effects in several ways. | tensor([ 4.2640, -5.0226])
Besides being physically and emotionally relaxing, massage improves blood and lymph circulation, reduces nerve irritation and brings fresh oxygen and other nutrients to the affected tissues. | tensor([ 3.7982, -4.3938])
Massage may also cause the body to produce fewer stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine (formerly adrenalin), and may also increase the body's production of pain-killing endorphins and the mood-altering hormone serotonin.\n\n  While seeing a professional massage therapist is relatively expensive, a friend or family member may be able to learn enough technique from a book or video to provide some relief for you. | tensor([ 4.3187, -5.1560])

There are at least 3 types of beta receptors in the body - beta 1, 2, and 3 - and they are sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine. | tensor([ 4.1538, -4.9499])
beta 1 controls heart rate and force of contraction in the heart (an increase in these will increase blood pressure, thus blocking them will lower blood pressure). | tensor([ 4.5118, -5.7617])
beta 2 controls smooth muscle many places in the body. | tensor([ 4.5974, -5.7296])
beta 3 receptors have less well defined role in fat metabolism.\n\nThe late American scientist Raymond Ahlqvist suggested already in 1948 that opposite effects of catecholamines were mediated by different receptors in the target organs, which he called alpha- and beta-receptors. http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1988/press.html | tensor([ 4.5049, -5.5020])

Oftentimes, we mean "An organized, militant Evangelical movement originating in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century in opposition to Protestant Liberalism and secularism, insisting on the inerrancy of Scripture." | tensor([ 4.7020, -5.8602])
\n\nBut the concept of fundamentalism can be extended to any ideology or theology whose tenents include a strict adherance to a code, especially one which demands the observance by persons who do not subscribe to that code.\n\nNaturally, this makes for a source of conflict. | tensor([ 4.6373, -5.5551])

Furthermore, you believe you have a duty to prevent wrongdoing altogether. | tensor([ 4.6983, -5.8459])
Consequently, you have a moral obligation to prevent any person from doing that act - including people who do not think that act is wrong.\n\nAny critical examination of a dogmatic theology or ideology will reveal how necessary this is, yet any objective look at disparate cultures will reveal how subjective - and frightening - this can be.\n\nThe hope of the future is that fundamentalist evangelism will be enacted by appeal to reason rather than dictates of law. | tensor([ 4.0192, -4.6918])

Since the move to the Ballpark at Arlington, the Rangers have had pitchers selected to attend the All-Star game, which suggests it's not a question of pitchers' willingness to play there, but greater concerns about contracts or the future of the franchise. | tensor([ 4.3302, -5.6899])

A gas-operated firearm operates on a similar principle of a car engine. | tensor([ 4.4676, -5.4228])
When a round is fired, expanding gases propel the bullet out of the barrel, along with most of the gas. | tensor([ 4.4007, -5.4616])
But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. | tensor([ 4.0615, -4.8654])
A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. | tensor([ 4.5757, -5.5520])
When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. | tensor([ 4.3952, -5.4067])
The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. | tensor([ 4.5353, -5.7177])
the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight. | tensor([ 4.5516, -5.7818])

A cloud compsition is primarlly just billions of drops of water or ice. | tensor([ 4.2931, -5.0867])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
When such a cloud formation has an influx of water/ice, ie it's mass increases to include more water/ice, light finds it hard to pass through the mass, thus making it darker for us to see.\n\nIn a normal cloud, light can pass through the water/ice within the cloud and we see it as a distorted white/bluish/greyish/greenish hue. | tensor([ 4.5841, -5.6757])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
But when the cloud is too thick with water/ice, the light doesn't pass through so easily and we see a darker spectrum. | tensor([ 4.5787, -5.6913])

Inferred reality is defined as the meaning of stimuli in the context of relevant information.\n\n"Inclusion" is a term used by educators to describe a philosophical approach to the education of children with disabilities. | tensor([ 4.7211, -5.8092])
This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). | tensor([ 4.0960, -4.8545])
Drawing from the legacy of the Civil Rights movement, advocates of full inclusion for children with disabilities state that "Inclusion is the ultimate goal for all children with disabilities regardless of their disabilities or current placement" (New York State Education Department, cited in Shanker, 1993). | tensor([ 4.5983, -5.8908])
This is not without controversy. | tensor([ 4.5101, -5.7540])

Why do you dismiss Buddhism, Taoism etc? | tensor([ 4.6219, -5.8512])
You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\n\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. | tensor([ 3.5255, -3.9107])
Learn, and let it be your choice. | tensor([ 4.7560, -5.8754])
If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\n\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. | tensor([ 3.8640, -4.3995])
Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\n\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). | tensor([ 4.6437, -5.6210])
You can learn more on different religions by following the links | tensor([ 4.6172, -5.8585])

My opinion is that once you decide on something you should stick by it. | tensor([ 4.7272, -5.8963])

Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, is one of the most joyous times of the Jewish year. | tensor([ 3.3825, -3.6798])
\n\nThe reason for the celebration is twofold (both dating back to c. 165 BCE): \n\nthe miraculous military victory of the small, ill-equipped Jewish army over the ruling Greek Syrians, who had banned the Jewish religion and desecrated the Temple; \n\nand the miracle of the small cruse of consecrated oil, which burned for eight days in the Temple's menorah instead of just one. \n\n\nHanukkah is celebrated by: \n\na. lighting a menorah for eight nights with olive oil or wax candles; one on the first night and an additional one each succeeding night \n\nb. | tensor([ 3.9818, -4.6447])
eating food fried in oil, especially potato pancakes (latkes) and jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) \n\nc. playing with a dreidel, a four-sided top; the player wins or loses money depending on which side it lands on (each is marked with a different Hebrew letter)\n\nIn 1997, a 60-foot, 18-ton menorah was built in Latrun, Israel; a rabbi was lifted by crane each night to kindle the lights. | tensor([ 2.9697, -3.0390])
The same year, a 12-foot pyramid of 2,400 jelly doughnuts was built near Afula, Israel; the pastries were later distributed to soldiers serving near the northern border. | tensor([ 4.1336, -4.8615])

You can think of POSIX as a runtime standard for C, but for many reasons, some language/operating system providers decide to either not provide a determined function, change its parameters, its name or some criterion on how to handle the request.\nIf a certain operating system does support the full set of POSIX operations with the standard names, parameters and criteria, then they may certify that with IEEE.\nThat allows you to create a C program and, as long as you use only POSIX functions, it's bound to work correctly on any POSIX-conformant system.\n\nHope it helped! | tensor([ 4.6701, -5.8815])

It is possible for the winner of an election to get as little as 39% of the vote, and carry the electoral college. | tensor([ 4.6490, -5.8361])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This happens when the winner wins by only a handful of votes in states he or she wins, and losing completely in all other states.\nThis is caused by the lack of proportional voting in states.   | tensor([ 4.7183, -5.9155])

The short answer is, yes, of course they are tracking IPs. | tensor([ 4.6810, -5.8706])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The long answer to your other question follows.\n\nIt is a straight-forward, multistep process.\n\n1. | tensor([ 4.3759, -5.1636])
Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\n2. | tensor([ 4.7139, -5.8127])

Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\n\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\n\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file. | tensor([ 4.6313, -5.6406])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\n\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. | tensor([ 4.5857, -5.8383])
It may not be enough to find who did it | tensor([ 4.4168, -5.6544])
but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\n\nThere is probably more going on | tensor([ 4.6824, -5.8046])
but you get the idea. | tensor([ 4.3908, -5.6459])
At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\n\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. | tensor([ 4.6688, -5.6841])
And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\n\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\n\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school. | tensor([ 3.9605, -4.6029])

(if you trust the good folks at AcronymFinder.com). | tensor([ 4.6642, -5.8758])
Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. | tensor([ 4.4716, -5.7390])
As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. | tensor([ 4.6714, -5.8256])
Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. | tensor([ 4.4270, -5.7457])
Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a "feed").\n\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. | tensor([ 4.6568, -5.8679])
There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). | tensor([ 4.4839, -5.7923])
Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication "universe" right away. | tensor([ 4.3613, -5.6753])
Free readers are available as well; a search for "RSS Reader" at popular search sites will yield many results.\n\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). | tensor([ 4.6664, -5.8415])
Also, any upgrades or new features are added automatically. | tensor([ 4.4089, -5.6856])

This evidence comes from the fields of paleontology, paleogeography, biogeography, molecular biology, genetics, embryology, and probably lots of others. | tensor([ 4.4046, -5.6932])

The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. | tensor([ 4.4163, -5.7554])
Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\n\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. | tensor([ 4.6533, -5.8812])
It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\n\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. | tensor([ 4.6152, -5.8793])
Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\n\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. | tensor([ 4.6079, -5.8653])

Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\n\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). | tensor([ 4.5461, -5.8097])

The Marine Corps' war was in the Pacific and all war plans regarding the employment of Marines reflected that. | tensor([ 4.3728, -5.6726])
Nevertheless, because the Marine Corps was part of the naval establishment, it had responsibility also for furnishing men to parts of the Navy assigned to the European and Mediterranean theaters and to the operations conducted there.\n\nThese were not large Marine formations, but were, for the most part, individual Marines and small detachments assigned to guard duty at the barracks and naval operating bases established in the United Kingdom, or men assigned as "sea-going" Marines in the detachments of the large fighting ships. | tensor([ 4.5899, -5.8273])

Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. | tensor([ 4.5373, -5.8651])
The trade-off made is convenience for speed. | tensor([ 4.5512, -5.8266])
Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. | tensor([ 4.5636, -5.7992])
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. | tensor([ 4.2921, -5.6486])
Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. | tensor([ 4.4631, -5.7447])
Their work has yet to be completed. | tensor([ 4.5426, -5.7357])
The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. | tensor([ 4.5909, -5.8333])
Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. | tensor([ 4.6048, -5.8370])
Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. | tensor([ 4.6458, -5.8954])
Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. | tensor([ 4.4328, -5.7446])
These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. | tensor([ 4.4925, -5.7500])
If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. | tensor([ 4.4821, -5.7888])
This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. | tensor([ 4.7042, -5.8225])
The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. | tensor([ 4.5118, -5.7700])
This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. | tensor([ 4.4378, -5.7193])
Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. | tensor([ 4.7074, -5.8783])
The setup would most likely begin with a router. | tensor([ 4.5226, -5.7654])
This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. | tensor([ 4.7095, -5.8948])
There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. | tensor([ 4.5486, -5.6489])
These allow any wired device to be included on the network. | tensor([ 4.5305, -5.7953])
The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) | tensor([ 4.4437, -5.7480])
Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\n\n\nAdvantages/Conclusions\n\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. | tensor([ 4.6394, -5.8329])
It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. | tensor([ 4.6417, -5.8729])
Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. | tensor([ 4.5935, -5.7928])
If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. | tensor([ 4.6013, -5.8506])
The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. | tensor([ 4.3994, -5.7098])
Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. | tensor([ 4.5673, -5.8092])
Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. | tensor([ 4.4562, -5.7101])
Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. | tensor([ 4.4763, -5.7760])
Only then should 802.11n be considered. | tensor([ 4.5032, -5.8092])

Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. | tensor([ 4.6522, -5.7182])
Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). | tensor([ 4.6302, -5.8458])
The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. | tensor([ 4.6511, -5.6612])
We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. | tensor([ 4.7082, -5.7993])
It is contained in our mitochandria. | tensor([ 4.4363, -5.7114])
Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. | tensor([ 3.2500, -3.6250])
The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. | tensor([ 4.6389, -5.8890])
So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. | tensor([ 4.6265, -5.8323])
Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. | tensor([ 4.5915, -5.8018])
Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. | tensor([ 4.4977, -5.7875])
So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. | tensor([ 4.5319, -5.4856])
These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. | tensor([ 4.6262, -5.8170])
Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. | tensor([ 4.5744, -5.8206])
Let me give you an example. | tensor([ 4.6619, -5.8505])
Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. | tensor([ 4.6894, -5.7787])
An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. | tensor([ 4.7042, -5.9006])
Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. | tensor([ 3.4458, -3.7219])
Others will not be so lucky. | tensor([ 4.6019, -5.5333])
If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. | tensor([ 2.8657, -2.8439])
The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. | tensor([ 4.6854, -5.8922])
If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. | tensor([ 3.8499, -4.4530])
More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. | tensor([ 4.6534, -5.8397])
From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are. | tensor([ 4.6432, -5.8549])

"Mikołaj Kopernik (February 19, 1473–May 24, 1543), more commonly known by the Latin form Nicolaus Copernicus, was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and economist, mainly remembered for developing a scientifically useful heliocentric (Sun-centered) theory of the solar system. | tensor([ 4.6726, -5.8268])
His main occupations and services rendered were in Royal Prussia, as church canon, governor and administrator, economist, jurist, physician, astrologer and military leader (conducting defense against the Teutonic Order). | tensor([ 4.7176, -5.8275])
Amid all his responsibilities, he treated astronomy as a hobby. | tensor([ 4.7752, -5.8666])
His theory about the Sun as the center of the Universe, opposed to the traditional geocentric theory that placed Earth at the center, is considered one of the most important discoveries ever, and is the fundamental starting point of modern astronomy and modern science itself (it inaugurated a scientific revolution). | tensor([ 4.5974, -5.8464])
His theory affected many aspects of human life, opening the door for young astronomers, scientists and scholars to take a skeptical attitude toward established dogma." | tensor([ 4.6085, -5.8191])

Passion\n\nI've received the question about motivation to workout several times. | tensor([ 4.3214, -5.1033])
A bit back, I emailed a fellow who simply wished the question of motivation could be answered.\n\nI think the 2 most frequently asked questions that I address in my Beginners' Guide to Fitness and Bodybuilding are:\n\n1) | tensor([ 4.7148, -5.8119])
How do I get motivated?\n2) | tensor([ 4.7054, -5.7754])
How soon can I expect to see results?\n\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\n\nPassion\n\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\n\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. | tensor([ 3.8265, -4.3573])
Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. | tensor([ 3.8317, -4.3308])
Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\n\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. | tensor([ 4.3868, -5.1668])
It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. | tensor([ 4.0745, -4.7096])
Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. | tensor([ 4.2947, -5.0386])
So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. | tensor([ 4.7426, -5.7455])
Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. | tensor([ 4.6140, -5.5438])
In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\n\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out. | tensor([ 4.5642, -5.4496])
You can be very successful just doing 45 minutes a session, 3 times a week. | tensor([ 4.6841, -5.6638])

i never got one... looks like the system ain't perfect yet. | tensor([ 4.7384, -5.8215])
It may actually hurt you FICO score.\n\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. | tensor([ 2.7933, -2.9907])
So, let's take a look at an example:\n\n$200 total credit available\n$175 total credit used\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\n\n$5000 total credit available\n$1000 total credit used\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\n\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. | tensor([ 4.6847, -5.7158])
Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\n\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. | tensor([ 4.4380, -5.3453])
So it doesn’t matter what you do with them as long as you don’t stop paying them.\n\nIt’s best to just hold on to them. | tensor([ 2.8033, -2.8802])
You might even consider having the credit limit taken up (but don’t max them out). | tensor([ 4.7107, -5.8716])
It’s not how much of a limit you have that’s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you’re | tensor([ 3.6630, -4.1837])
using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. | tensor([ 4.3997, -5.2575])
To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you’re likely to just cancel it. | tensor([ 4.7146, -5.7994])
Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you’re worth.\n\nHope this helps. | tensor([ 2.7815, -2.8380])

\n\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. | tensor([ 3.5065, -3.8296])
He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity... | tensor([ 2.4265, -2.3737])
don't know why. | tensor([ 4.6911, -5.8510])
Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. | tensor([ 4.7299, -5.8689])
Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of "bad nasties". | tensor([ 2.4091, -2.3907])
I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store... | tensor([ 4.7505, -5.8498])
Victoria's Secret, to be exact. | tensor([ 4.4718, -5.7462])
My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. | tensor([ 4.7109, -5.8499])
He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. | tensor([ 4.6510, -5.8667])
It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. | tensor([ 3.6741, -4.2642])
But it just hit me oddly. | tensor([ 4.6720, -5.8743])
I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it... | tensor([ 4.6505, -5.8467])
that's what started the whole process. | tensor([ 4.4870, -5.7406])
By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. | tensor([ 4.1929, -4.9468])
I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. | tensor([ 1.5382, -1.5301])
Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. | tensor([ 4.7148, -5.7166])
So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want... | tensor([ 2.1607, -2.0782])
I'm not kidding. | tensor([ 4.0739, -4.8319])
True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating | tensor([ 4.1309, -4.8443])
but I also don't beat myself up about it. | tensor([ 4.4762, -5.3622])
If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. | tensor([ 2.6333, -2.7779])
When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. | tensor([ 4.7527, -5.8702])
The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. | tensor([ 2.7894, -2.8404])
I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. | tensor([ 3.5282, -3.9201])
As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. | tensor([ 3.3148, -3.5685])
So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. | tensor([ 2.7074, -2.7528])
Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) | tensor([ 4.0615, -4.7426])
I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes | tensor([ 4.3300, -5.1170])
where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. | tensor([ 3.6338, -4.0537])
I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. | tensor([ 2.4972, -2.4823])
I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages... | tensor([ 2.9850, -3.1439])
OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. | tensor([ 2.0666, -1.9751])
It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! | tensor([ 4.3236, -5.2125])
But you know what? | tensor([ 4.6321, -5.8583])
I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! | tensor([ 3.2007, -3.3985])
That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all | tensor([ 4.5924, -5.5092])
you should be able to access your pop account through webmail. | tensor([ 4.7180, -5.7990])
if you have your own domain, you should be able to access a control panel where you can check webmail through programs like Horde and squirrelmail.\n\nif it is a work account, talk to a tech person at your work to find out how you can access the account using a browser.\n\nmost ISPs (earthlink, verizon) also have webmail features. | tensor([ 4.7234, -5.8667])
call tech support or visit the company site to find out how. | tensor([ 4.6758, -5.8910])
Find you a copy of "Genki - An integrated course in Elementary Japanese" published by The Japan Times. | tensor([ 4.5835, -5.7836])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It's the best introduction to the language that I've found. | tensor([ 4.4324, -5.6729])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
You may be able to find one at your local library. | tensor([ 4.5567, -5.7642])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
If not, take a look at TheJapanShop.net or Amazon.com or JList.com | tensor([ 4.6716, -5.8836])
I wouldn't recommend that you do that. | tensor([ 4.6779, -5.8832])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about "learning" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think. | tensor([ 4.0465, -4.6941])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used. | tensor([ 4.5181, -5.7778])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language). | tensor([ 4.7061, -5.8689])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. | tensor([ 4.7308, -5.8361])
Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. | tensor([ 4.4883, -5.4277])
Go for it! | tensor([ 3.8719, -4.5208])
You are being used for booty and will never be anything more to him. | tensor([ 2.0704, -2.0061])

that's the simple version. | tensor([ 4.4682, -5.7124])
unless the cracking is painful, it is not unusual or dangerous for your knees to "crack".\n\nLunges are excellent for strengthening the muscles around the knee joint. | tensor([ 3.5034, -3.9121])
Make sure that you are not leaning over the knee, that the knee is right above the foot during the lunge and that you maintain a straight upright movement.\n\nDo not do hamstring excercises that will pull on the knee joint if you have problems with your knee. | tensor([ 2.4071, -2.3754])
\n\nelipticals are good for running on with minimal knee and ankle stress. | tensor([ 3.3555, -3.6836])
\n\nyou can also get large elastic bands...stand in them, and step out to the side pulling on the bands, then back in. | tensor([ 3.4719, -3.8717])
Don't pull harder than is comfortable, this will help increase the stablization of the knee.\n\nLaying on your back you can pull your knee to your chest, and then extend it, locking your knee holding the leg just over the ground..repeating, this will also help strengthen the muscles around the knee with minimal weight on it.\n\nAlways is good to speak with a doctor or physical therapist if you have concerns. | tensor([ 3.1186, -3.3370])

However, she had a mean streak in her... | tensor([ 4.7061, -5.8721])
\n\nI think it's entirely possible (seeing as how true to the book the previous two movies were as far as the characters go) that Psylocke would start out bad, and yet come into Xavier's fold.   | tensor([ 4.2700, -5.0794])

A way around a Static IP is using a Dynamic DNS provider like No-IP. | tensor([ 4.6447, -5.7375])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
You install a small program on your pc that updates your ip address each time it changes. | tensor([ 4.6126, -5.5821])

Then you can access your ip using Dynamic DNS. | tensor([ 4.6772, -5.7680])

Ottoman Empire also Turkish Empire\n\nA vast Turkish sultanate of southwest Asia, northeast Africa, and southeast Europe. | tensor([ 4.7124, -5.8153])
It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after | tensor([ 4.3119, -5.5614])
World War I. | tensor([ 4.5637, -5.6524])
Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\n\n\nOttoman Empire (ŏt'əmən) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. | tensor([ 4.6574, -5.6885])
Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\nOrganization of the Empire\n\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. | tensor([ 4.6656, -5.8070])
Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. | tensor([ 4.5273, -5.7438])
Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\n\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. | tensor([ 3.4639, -3.7706])
Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. | tensor([ 3.7017, -4.0922])
Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. | tensor([ 4.6816, -5.7665])
The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. | tensor([ 3.6319, -3.9338])
When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\n\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). | tensor([ 2.3496, -2.1994])
The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\n\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. | tensor([ 3.8531, -4.3479])
The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. | tensor([ 4.6049, -5.6122])
They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. | tensor([ 4.6269, -5.6051])
The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\n\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. | tensor([ 2.0969, -2.0726])
This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. | tensor([ 4.0730, -4.8643])

law.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. | tensor([ 4.6768, -5.7065])
The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. | tensor([ 4.4658, -5.7410])
The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. | tensor([ 4.3059, -5.6097])
Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. | tensor([ 4.5034, -5.6063])
The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. | tensor([ 4.6209, -5.7020])
The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. | tensor([ 4.6311, -5.6612])

There are such values, called R-values. | tensor([ 4.2661, -5.5928])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])

  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
These are English units, hour-degreeF-ft^2/BTU.   | tensor([ 4.7258, -5.7799])

There are actually several "planet like" objects beyond Pluto in an area called the Kuiper belt that contains thousands of objects that circle the sun.\n\nAt present none of them have been officially recognized as new planets. | tensor([ 4.5735, -5.7212])
\nThe discovery of these new planet size objects including  2003 UB313 (nicknamed XENA), Sedna(in 2004) and Quaoar(in 2002 by the same team) have triggered a re-evaluation of the necessary criteria to call something a planet.\n\nIt is likely that this team at Caltech will  discover other objects to be added to the list of potential "planets" in our solar system.\n\n2003 UB313(nicknamed XENA unofficially) is larger than Pluto which leaves officials in a bit of dilemna. | tensor([ 4.5069, -5.4925])

This is a true question of semantics and religion. | tensor([ 4.6400, -5.8529])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.   | tensor([ 4.6197, -5.6354])
Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice. | tensor([ 4.7039, -5.8824])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called "faith" and the controlling of culture through that so-called "faith"...thereby falling into suspicion of "satanic" influences. | tensor([ 4.6010, -5.8379])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\n\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.   | tensor([ 4.6461, -5.6676])
Furthermore, any member of a masonic society will claim no knowledge of satanic connections to their brotherhood. | tensor([ 4.7514, -5.7193])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
The secrets of these societies are replete with whispers of foul play and undertones of godless or godlike actions and/or beliefs. | tensor([ 2.9587, -2.9313])
 \n\nYour answer lies in your question. | tensor([ 4.3432, -5.0595])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
What is that you believe is satanic, what is your understanding of the subject your curiosity stems from, and whether or not you are willing to see what is beneath the surface.... | tensor([ 4.4100, -5.2266])
this is what will lead you to a more accurate answer to this question. | tensor([ 4.5453, -5.7825])

A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a "pure" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned. | tensor([ 4.5798, -5.6878])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once. | tensor([ 4.3918, -5.7312])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance. | tensor([ 4.4370, -5.5075])
  | tensor([ 4.0106, -4.6634])
That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells). | tensor([ 4.2410, -5.1211])

Ecotourism is loosely defined as nature-based tourist experiences, whereby visitors travel to regions for the sole purpose of appreciating their natural beauty.\n\nHard ecotourism is intense sometimes strenuous ecotourism that may involve non-hotel accommodations. | tensor([ 4.7048, -5.8415])
It tends toward longer, specialized trips by small groups within a wilderness or semi-wilderness setting mediated by minimal services; also called active, deep or eco-specialist ecotourism, this constitutes only a very small portion of the total ecotourism sector.\n\nSoft ecotourism is the most common form, where tourists hope to observe nature and culture closely, but casually. | tensor([ 4.6904, -5.8521])
It is technically defined as ecotourism that tends toward shorter, multi-purpose trips within well-serviced areas frequented by large numbers of ecotourists; also called passive, shallow or popular or eco-generalist ecotourism, this accounts for most ecotourism activity. | tensor([ 4.5142, -5.7672])

Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. | tensor([ 4.4295, -5.7403])
Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\n\nTime is often referred to as the "fourth dimension". | tensor([ 4.4361, -5.7420])
It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. | tensor([ 4.4652, -5.6853])
It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. | tensor([ 4.3798, -5.6946])
The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\n\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. | tensor([ 4.6046, -5.7984])
As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size. | tensor([ 4.5102, -5.7664])
