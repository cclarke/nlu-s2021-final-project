In the United States, the agencies that govern prisons are often called ‘Department of Corrections.’ | tensor([ 4.5309, -5.8180])
And yet, their focus is on containing and controlling inmates. | tensor([ 3.6713, -4.1982])
Dan Pacholke, Deputy Secretary for the Washington State Department of Corrections, shares a different vision: of prisons that provide humane living conditions as well as opportunities for meaningful work and learning. | tensor([ 4.6357, -5.8644])

We often think of bias and prejudice as rooted in ignorance. | tensor([ 4.1316, -4.9503])
But as psychologist Paul Bloom seeks to show, prejudice is often natural, rational ... even moral. | tensor([ 4.5747, -5.6211])

Hamish Jolly, an ocean swimmer in Australia, wanted a wetsuit that would deter a curious shark from mistaking him for a potential source of nourishment. | tensor([ 2.6500, -2.5890])
(Which, statistically, is rare, but certainly a fate worth avoiding.) | tensor([ 4.5528, -5.8063])
Working with a team of scientists, he and his friends came up with a fresh approach — not a shark cage, not a suit of chain-mail, but a sleek suit that taps our growing understanding of shark vision. | tensor([ 4.6433, -5.7322])

We're all familiar with satellite imagery, but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date. | tensor([ 4.3291, -5.6407])
That's because satellites are big and expensive, so there aren't that many of them up in space. | tensor([ 4.4006, -5.4159])
As he explains in this fascinating talk, Dan Berkenstock and his team came up with a different solution, designing a cheap, lightweight satellite with a radically new approach to photographing what's going on on Earth. | tensor([ 4.6085, -5.8291])
Dan Berkenstock: The world is one big dataset. | tensor([ 3.8414, -4.4239])

Animal behavior isn't complicated, but it is complex. | tensor([ 4.5425, -5.7984])
Nicolas Perony studies how individual animals -- be they Scottish Terriers, bats or meerkats -- follow simple rules that, collectively, create larger patterns of behavior. | tensor([ 4.6442, -5.8133])
And how this complexity born of simplicity can help them adapt to new circumstances, as they arise. | tensor([ 4.5510, -5.7889])

McKenna Pope's younger brother loved to cook, but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven -- because it was a toy for girls. | tensor([ 3.0651, -3.1772])
So at age 13, Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing. | tensor([ 4.4977, -5.4572])
In a heartening talk, Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless. | tensor([ 2.7640, -2.8468])

2013 was a year of hype for MOOCs (massive open online courses). | tensor([ 4.6716, -5.7749])
Great big numbers and great big hopes were followed by some disappointing first results. | tensor([ 4.6514, -5.8348])
But the head of edX, Anant Agarwal, makes the case that MOOCs still matter -- as a way to share high-level learning widely and supplement (but perhaps not replace) traditional classrooms. | tensor([ 4.6090, -5.8185])
Agarwal shares his vision of blended learning, where teachers create the ideal learning experience for 21st century students. | tensor([ 4.6273, -5.8389])

Why do people feel so miserable and disengaged at work? | tensor([ 3.4179, -3.9257])
Because today's businesses are increasingly and dizzyingly complex -- and traditional pillars of management are obsolete, says Yves Morieux. | tensor([ 4.6503, -5.7859])
So, he says, it falls to individual employees to navigate the rabbit's warren of interdependencies. | tensor([ 4.4881, -5.4002])

Every cell in the human body has a sex, which means that men and women are different right down to the cellular level. | tensor([ 2.9896, -3.0652])
Yet too often, research and medicine ignore this insight -- and the often startlingly different ways in which the two sexes respond to disease or treatment. | tensor([ 4.6396, -5.7742])
As pioneering doctor Paula Johnson describes in this thought-provoking talk, lumping everyone in together means we essentially leave women's health to chance. | tensor([ 4.7204, -5.7741])

What happens when you get an entire audience to stand up and connect with one another? | tensor([ 4.5708, -5.4678])
Chaos, that's what. | tensor([ 4.6399, -5.8693])
At least, that's what happened when Jane McGonigal tried to teach TED to play her favorite game. | tensor([ 4.6082, -5.5728])

Chris Downey: Design with the blind in mind | tensor([ 3.5147, -3.9616])
The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. | tensor([ 4.7329, -5.8415])
Those in emerging markets often don't have that luxury. | tensor([ 4.6627, -5.8568])
In this powerful talk, economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can't afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. | tensor([ 4.5316, -5.4343])
Instead, a different model, embodied by China, is increasingly appealing. | tensor([ 4.5696, -5.8009])
A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world. | tensor([ 4.7410, -5.8328])

Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity -- whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. | tensor([ 4.6537, -5.8913])
This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen. | tensor([ 4.6976, -5.8681])

Every day! | tensor([ 3.6327, -3.9947])
This astonishing statistic is just one of the reasons Robin Nagle started a research project with the city's Department of Sanitation. | tensor([ 4.5897, -5.5303])
She walked the routes, operated mechanical brooms, even drove a garbage truck herself--all so she could answer a simple-sounding but complicated question: who cleans up after us? | tensor([ 3.2253, -3.4628])

Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident and, for the past 27 years, the area around the plant has been known as the Exclusion Zone. | tensor([ 3.4194, -3.7661])
And yet, a community of about 200 people live there -- almost all of them elderly women. | tensor([ 4.7733, -5.8533])
These proud grandmas defied orders to relocate because their connection to their homeland and to their community are "forces that rival even radiation." | tensor([ 4.3150, -5.1733])
Holly Morris: Why stay in Chernobyl? | tensor([ 4.6617, -5.7604])
Because it's home. | tensor([ 4.6903, -5.7346])
One year ago, Abha Dawesar was living in blacked-out Manhattan post-Sandy, scrounging for power to connect. | tensor([ 4.3709, -5.2558])
As a novelist, she was struck by this metaphor: Have our lives now become fixated on the drive to digitally connect, while we miss out on what's real? | tensor([ 4.7348, -5.8587])
Abha Dawesar: Life in the "digital now" | tensor([ 4.6139, -5.5212])
Biologist Mohamed Hijri brings to light a farming crisis no one is talking about: We are running out of phosphorus, an essential element that's a key component of DNA and the basis of cellular communication. | tensor([ 4.7044, -5.8529])
All roads of this crisis lead back to how we farm -- with chemical fertilizers chock-full of the element, which plants are not efficient at absorbing. | tensor([ 4.0152, -4.7117])

When TED Fellow Xavier Vilalta was commissioned to create a multistory shopping mall in Addis Ababa, he panicked. | tensor([ 4.0303, -4.6862])
Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architecture: wasteful, glass towers requiring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. | tensor([ 3.0579, -3.2033])
In this charming talk, Vilalta shows how he champions an alternative approach: to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, modern, iconic buildings fit for a community. | tensor([ 4.5513, -5.7880])
Xavier Vilalta: Architecture at home in its community | tensor([ 4.5759, -5.8064])
The biggest surprise of discovering the Higgs boson? | tensor([ 4.6119, -5.8311])
That there were no surprises. | tensor([ 4.7408, -5.8394])
Gian Giudice talks us through a problem in theoretical physics: what if the Higgs field exists in an ultra-dense state that could mean the collapse of all atomic matter? | tensor([ 4.5796, -5.7857])
With wit and charm, Giudice outlines a grim fate -- and why we shouldn't start worrying just yet. | tensor([ 4.1243, -4.8114])

The past decade has seen slow and steady economic growth across the continent of Africa. | tensor([ 4.5918, -5.8102])
But economist Charles Robertson has a bold thesis: | tensor([ 4.4726, -5.7332])
Africa's about to boom. | tensor([ 4.4223, -5.2528])
He talks through a few of the indicators -- from rising education levels to expanded global investment (and not just from China) -- that lead him to predict rapid growth for a billion people, sooner than you may think. | tensor([ 4.5426, -5.8037])

The line between public and private has blurred in the past decade, both online and in real life, and Alessandro Acquisti is here to explain what this means and why it matters. | tensor([ 4.4305, -5.7233])
In this thought-provoking, slightly chilling talk, he shares details of recent and ongoing research -- including a project that shows how easy it is to match a photograph of a stranger with their sensitive personal information. | tensor([ 4.6156, -5.8441])
Alessandro Acquisti: What will a future without secrets look like? | tensor([ 4.6098, -5.8530])
In the center of Caracas, Venezuela, stands the 45-story "Tower of David," an unfinished, abandoned skyscraper. | tensor([ 4.4439, -5.3807])
But about eight years ago, people started moving in. | tensor([ 4.5903, -5.8134])

Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days, too. | tensor([ 4.5656, -5.4645])
Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of "denial." | tensor([ 4.5398, -5.4228])
She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life. | tensor([ 4.6585, -5.8364])

Physician Gary Slutkin spent a decade fighting tuberculosis, cholera and AIDS epidemics in Africa. | tensor([ 3.0414, -3.0320])
When he returned to the United States, he thought he'd escape brutal epidemic deaths. | tensor([ 2.8487, -2.7837])
But then he began to look more carefully at gun violence, noting that its spread followed the patterns of infectious diseases. | tensor([ 4.6513, -5.7122])
A mind-flipping look at a problem that too many communities have accepted as a given. | tensor([ 4.6121, -5.5650])
We've reversed the impact of so many diseases, says Slutkin, and we can do the same with violence. | tensor([ 3.2246, -3.3826])

In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it's fair to say that an American's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. | tensor([ 4.6705, -5.8575])
(Three key examples: access to education, access to justice, political influence.) | tensor([ 4.5372, -5.7969])
In a talk and audience discussion, Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale? | tensor([ 4.6701, -5.8957])
Michael Sandel: Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life | tensor([ 4.7216, -5.8609])
Why do we turn to nonprofits, NGOs and governments to solve society's biggest problems? | tensor([ 4.7045, -5.8029])
Michael Porter admits he's biased, as a business school professor, but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water. | tensor([ 4.6968, -5.7321])

It's a classic underdog tale: David, a young shepherd armed only with a sling, beats Goliath, the mighty warrior. | tensor([ 2.8962, -2.7871])
The story has transcended its biblical origins to become a common shorthand for unlikely victory. | tensor([ 4.6222, -5.8602])
But, asks Malcolm Gladwell, is that really what the David and Goliath story is about? | tensor([ 4.5286, -5.8002])

It's called the "Flynn effect" -- the fact that each generation scores higher on an IQ test than the generation before it. | tensor([ 4.5815, -5.8180])
Are we actually getting smarter, or just thinking differently? | tensor([ 4.6950, -5.7912])
In this fast-paced spin through the cognitive history of the 20th century, moral philosopher James Flynn suggests that changes in the way we think have had surprising (and not always positive) consequences. | tensor([ 4.6734, -5.8792])
James Flynn: Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents' | tensor([ 4.7207, -5.7921])
Trust is on the decline, and we need to rebuild it. | tensor([ 4.7306, -5.9064])
That’s a commonly heard suggestion for making a better world … but, says philosopher Onora | tensor([ 4.6791, -5.8660])
O’Neill, we don’t really understand what we're suggesting. | tensor([ 4.6620, -5.8601])

What does real scientific work look like? | tensor([ 4.5527, -5.7607])
As neuroscientist Stuart Firestein jokes: It looks a lot less like the scientific method and a lot more like "farting around … in the dark. | tensor([ 1.9137, -1.8939])
In this witty talk, Firestein gets to the heart of science as it is really practiced and suggests that we should value what we don’t know -- or “high-quality ignorance” -- just as much as what we know. | tensor([ 4.0787, -4.7322])

Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus studies memories. | tensor([ 4.6469, -5.8800])
More precisely, she studies false memories, when people either remember things that didn't happen or remember them differently from the way they really were. | tensor([ 4.6397, -5.7606])
It's more common than you might think, and Loftus shares some startling stories and statistics, and raises some important ethical questions we should all remember to consider. | tensor([ 4.5876, -5.8269])

It often seems like federal-level politicians care more about creating gridlock than solving the world's problems. | tensor([ 4.6635, -5.8505])
So who's actually getting bold things done? | tensor([ 4.4906, -5.7393])
City mayors. | tensor([ 4.4326, -5.7325])
So, political theorist Benjamin Barber suggests: Let's give them more control over global policy. | tensor([ 4.6630, -5.8748])
Barber shows how these "urban homeboys" are solving pressing problems on their own turf -- and maybe in the world. | tensor([ 4.5010, -5.3977])

Alexa Meade takes an innovative approach to art. | tensor([ 4.6420, -5.8568])
Not for her a life of sketching and stretching canvases. | tensor([ 3.7084, -4.1710])
Instead, she selects a topic and then paints it--literally. | tensor([ 4.5916, -5.7791])
She covers everything in a scene--people, chairs, food, you name it--in a mask of paint that mimics what's below it. | tensor([ 4.5727, -5.5479])
