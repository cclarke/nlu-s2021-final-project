Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 5.4832, -2.1360, -3.1412])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. | tensor([ 5.6714, -2.1957, -3.2355])
Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 5.4494, -2.1008, -3.1516])
 \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. | tensor([ 5.2872, -2.0771, -3.0423])
 Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. | tensor([ 5.2491, -2.0435, -3.0444])
When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly. | tensor([ 5.4679, -2.1596, -3.1041])

Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. | tensor([ 4.6098, -1.9770, -2.5697])
The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises "bad" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. | tensor([ 4.4741, -1.9146, -2.5693])
\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. | tensor([ 4.6442, -1.8563, -2.7750])
In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods. | tensor([ 5.0193, -1.9678, -2.9310])

renting vs buying depends on your goals. | tensor([ 5.3483, -2.0763, -3.0671])
<br />\ngenerally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. | tensor([ 4.8195, -1.9132, -2.8061])
the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.\nhaving said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). | tensor([ 5.2221, -2.0174, -3.0413])
it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.\nbottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. | tensor([ 4.4974, -1.8249, -2.6760])
the other numbers tend to even out, the main gain or loss in buying comes from appreciation/depreciation. | tensor([ 5.0651, -1.9581, -2.9742])
There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning. | tensor([ 5.1974, -2.0756, -2.9741])
\nAfter turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles. | tensor([ 3.9030, -1.8399, -2.3216])
\nUse the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys. \nDampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys. | tensor([ 3.9581, -1.8849, -2.3003])
\nUse the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris. | tensor([ 4.4224, -1.9258, -2.5080])
<br />\nIf | tensor([ 4.8083, -1.8422, -2.8289])
you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. | tensor([ 4.3511, -1.9664, -2.4228])
If you are still feeling industrious, next you can tackle cleaning your mouse. | tensor([ 4.8128, -1.9961, -2.7193])
\nOf course, if cleaning your keyboard seems a truly undesirable task, you can always buy a new one for around $20. | tensor([ 4.5148, -1.9117, -2.5847])
from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. | tensor([ 5.4111, -2.0554, -3.1713])
It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "fight or flight" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. | tensor([ 3.3391, -1.8074, -2.1183])
<br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. | tensor([ 4.9542, -1.9213, -2.9214])
As a result of the "fight or flight" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. | tensor([ 4.5950, -1.9465, -2.6317])
\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. | tensor([ 4.0815, -1.8580, -2.3956])
The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. | tensor([ 4.7768, -1.8946, -2.8313])
\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. | tensor([-0.9615, -1.2444,  3.3531])
So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness. | tensor([ 3.1324, -1.8018, -2.0183])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
Everyone has different definition on what 'beauty' is. | tensor([ 4.7687, -1.8630, -2.8560])

I like Lin Qingxia, but I think many girls are prettier than she was. | tensor([-2.3715, -1.7653,  4.5327])
(She is more than 40 years old now). | tensor([ 2.8170, -1.7470, -1.8815])
"Lin Qingxia" is the most beautiful woman in the Chinese cinema, the most handsome man in Chinese cinema should be "Chin Han" because they always made movies together.\nHowever, A male movie star once was asked his girlfriend in real life or the girlfriend in movie is more beautiful.   | tensor([ 3.7688, -1.7409, -2.3503])
He gave a very good answer: "I think my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world." | tensor([ 4.3169, -1.8992, -2.5346])

Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film "Tango & Cash". | tensor([ 4.7800, -1.9100, -2.8189])
After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. | tensor([ 0.4874, -0.0675, -0.0410])
Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass, their conversation was as follows:\nGabriel Cash: I don't know about you, but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...\nRay | tensor([ 0.8444, -0.5978, -0.3896])
What's F.U.B.A.R.?\nGabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition. | tensor([-1.1674, -1.1483,  3.3869])
A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. | tensor([ 4.9189, -1.9138, -2.9229])
Since you asked "how the human species evolved? | tensor([ 4.1370, -1.7572, -2.5934])
" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. | tensor([ 4.2175, -1.8815, -2.4550])
Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. | tensor([ 5.5500, -2.1458, -3.2163])
The pressures for "fit" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). | tensor([ 5.3765, -2.0824, -3.0977])
These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology. | tensor([ 5.6192, -2.1227, -3.2306])
That is kind of a tricky little quote. | tensor([ 4.7304, -1.8311, -2.8479])
Sometimes placing it in context can help. | tensor([ 4.9801, -1.8708, -3.0363])
This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self Reliance," which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). | tensor([ 5.0644, -1.9485, -2.9853])
\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. | tensor([ 5.6928, -2.1748, -3.2535])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the "independence of solitude"). | tensor([ 5.0250, -1.9663, -2.9229])
However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. | tensor([ 5.3340, -2.0370, -3.1088])
Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a "finished man" can truly do. | tensor([ 4.8230, -1.9716, -2.7624])
Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. | tensor([ 3.7990, -1.7649, -2.3908])
So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced "perfect sweetness" comes in. | tensor([ 4.4041, -1.8392, -2.6228])
When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. | tensor([ 5.2563, -2.0346, -3.0277])
\nWhat do you think? | tensor([ 4.9307, -1.9203, -2.8922])
There are several websites that you can find rare or out of print books. | tensor([ 5.5222, -2.0970, -3.2017])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
A couple would be alibris.com or abebooks.com. | tensor([ 3.0920, -1.6920, -2.0823])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
These sites list books by booksellers all over the country and some internationally. | tensor([ 5.1758, -1.9581, -3.0679])
the most basic thing is to have someone you have a decent amount of trust for. | tensor([ 4.8455, -1.8850, -2.8620])
someone recommended by a friend etc.\nthe things you have to look for are:<br />\n1. | tensor([ 4.8656, -1.8995, -2.8772])
top priority is seeing that the broker can actually get your loan on time. | tensor([ 5.2740, -2.0327, -3.0855])
many deals fall through b/c the broker cannot get the deal through on time and has less control than the original lender<br />\n2. | tensor([ 4.8939, -1.8837, -2.9037])
secondary priority is to see that they have access to competitive rates. | tensor([ 5.5125, -2.1088, -3.2004])
not all brokers have access to all sources and rates, although most of them will be similar.<br />\n3. | tensor([ 5.1743, -1.9663, -3.0396])
you need to see that the broker is someone you trust to get you the best rate regardless of how much money they make off the transaction. | tensor([ 4.9717, -1.9224, -2.9302])
Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD. | tensor([ 5.4198, -2.1038, -3.1055])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you. | tensor([ 5.1714, -2.0183, -2.9752])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.\nIf you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ . | tensor([ 5.3249, -2.0425, -3.0950])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
This process is not very straightforward though.\nIf you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS. | tensor([ 5.2341, -2.0309, -3.0371])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want. | tensor([ 5.2811, -2.0175, -3.0650])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs. | tensor([ 5.4784, -2.1175, -3.1564])
IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values, needs, etc.). | tensor([ 3.9150, -1.7998, -2.3883])
Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce, and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want, and you get an increasing percentage.\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.\nA parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life? | tensor([ 4.3701, -1.7924, -2.6371])
(grade school, high school, college, jobs, etc.). | tensor([ 4.6240, -1.9144, -2.6880])
We are a nomadic species. | tensor([ 4.1397, -1.7496, -2.5435])
Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number, as in i^2 = -1, where i is the imaginary number. | tensor([ 4.2412, -1.8424, -2.5264])
You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 | tensor([ 3.3399, -1.7051, -2.2501])
(that's the square root of -1).\nDon't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math, such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. | tensor([ 4.7979, -1.9297, -2.7716])
The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones, it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :) | tensor([ 4.0473, -1.7831, -2.4596])
We're pretty far away from being able to beam anything in the way that you are describing. | tensor([ 4.9612, -1.9659, -2.8820])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
There are some experiments where splitting entangled electrons allows us to observe some interesting 'action at a distance' effects, but the amount of data that would need to be stored to transmit something with as many atoms as a pizza is incredible.   | tensor([ 5.2333, -2.0454, -3.0175])
Also, such an operation would require nano-assemblers that could interpret such data an reassemble the pizza from the info provided. | tensor([ 5.0003, -1.9709, -2.9090])
CCM Magazine or their online website will give you information on up and coming artists in the Christian Music field. | tensor([ 5.6278, -2.1521, -3.2330])
You also need to consider the economic effects of funding basic research. | tensor([ 5.6409, -2.1396, -3.2466])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
The moon missions of the 60's inspired an entire generation and helped to move many kids toward careers in science and engineering. | tensor([ 5.5605, -2.1521, -3.1527])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
As a result, the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades. | tensor([ 5.2113, -2.0000, -3.0500])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions. | tensor([ 5.6360, -2.1624, -3.2303])
The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. | tensor([ 4.9640, -2.0119, -2.8233])
It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. | tensor([ 5.2652, -2.0392, -3.0813])
Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in. | tensor([ 3.7188, -1.7976, -2.2322])
Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). | tensor([ 4.6007, -2.0450, -2.4206])
Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. | tensor([ 5.4009, -2.1026, -3.1119])
Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. | tensor([ 5.2311, -2.0442, -3.0198])
Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. | tensor([ 5.0422, -1.9952, -2.9361])
If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. | tensor([ 4.7385, -1.9358, -2.7494])
This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. | tensor([ 4.8533, -1.9402, -2.8288])
For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium. | tensor([ 4.5948, -1.9271, -2.6099])

I can't tell you which of the many are best, but I can tell you about one I lived in briefly.\nI lived for a month in the Avalon at 4th and King. | tensor([ 4.7266, -1.8962, -2.7747])
I was put up there as a corporate apartment. | tensor([ 4.7092, -1.9150, -2.7384])
While it was fine, it was relatively expensive, and the rooms were small. | tensor([ 5.4014, -2.0923, -3.0781])
It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. | tensor([ 4.9121, -1.9620, -2.8396])
I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms, which are particularly American. | tensor([ 4.1155, -1.7772, -2.4871])
The smell of cooking, people watching TV, people eating -- these all seem like activities that should be separated from one another. | tensor([ 4.5822, -1.9436, -2.6202])
Call me old fashioned. | tensor([ 2.9342, -1.7495, -1.8639])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
\nThe Avalon had a big gym, however, which was very good, and concierge service, which was very convenient. | tensor([ 5.1718, -2.0497, -2.9164])
Most of them were very friendly. | tensor([ 4.5651, -1.7858, -2.7829])
One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!   | tensor([ 3.6213, -1.7666, -2.3281])
Also convenient was its proximity to the Caltrain, the Safeway across the street and the Starbucks. | tensor([ 4.3716, -1.8626, -2.5365])
But if you crave culture, this ain't it: everything is a chain store nearby.\nSo depending on your budget, your need for convenience and culture, and your tolerance for small rooms and/or omnirooms, it may suit you. | tensor([ 4.5445, -1.8705, -2.6578])

It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.   | tensor([ 5.2195, -2.0205, -3.0457])

On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state. | tensor([ 4.1898, -1.7950, -2.5588])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals. | tensor([ 4.8817, -1.9401, -2.8572])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])

As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. | tensor([ 4.7599, -1.9412, -2.7494])
Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. | tensor([ 4.4459, -1.9471, -2.5554])
People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. | tensor([ 4.3430, -1.8409, -2.5949])
\n\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. | tensor([ 4.1732, -1.7853, -2.5632])
So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. | tensor([ 4.9989, -1.9760, -2.8968])
Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. | tensor([ 4.8773, -1.9464, -2.8586])

  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear). | tensor([ 5.1981, -1.9967, -3.0481])

Found an interesting article on this...\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. | tensor([ 5.2563, -2.0663, -3.0272])
During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. | tensor([ 4.8403, -2.0388, -2.7310])
These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. | tensor([ 4.8393, -1.9717, -2.7913])

From my personal experience, I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects. | tensor([ 3.9483, -1.7569, -2.4883])
\nMy mom's brother was the favorite- she was the least favored. | tensor([ 3.1529, -1.7389, -1.9793])
50 years later, she still struggles with feeling inadequate and has a hard time trusting people. | tensor([ 4.1082, -1.7861, -2.5427])
Because of this, she has a hard time maintaining friendships and family relationships.\nMy grandmother and her sister were treated differently by my great-grandfather. | tensor([ 2.9717, -1.7547, -1.9675])
My grandmother was treated as the most special. | tensor([ 1.1569, -0.7361, -0.7162])
Her sister was expected to do chores, take care of the family etc. | tensor([ 3.5514, -1.8011, -2.3311])
She ended up being the dependable, reliable one because she developed her independence. | tensor([ 4.4158, -1.8192, -2.6558])
She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. | tensor([ 3.1561, -1.6974, -2.1461])
My grandmother grew up needing others to take care of her.\nThis is a pattern I've seen. | tensor([ 5.0748, -1.9898, -2.9504])

To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins.\n\nThis fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.\n\nNow for the second part of your question:\n\nThe light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun. | tensor([ 5.4146, -2.1129, -3.1208])

Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. | tensor([ 4.2578, -1.7906, -2.6033])
And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. | tensor([ 2.9772, -1.6841, -1.9568])
Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\n\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year. | tensor([ 3.6646, -1.7398, -2.3139])

I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\n\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious "soapbar" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then). | tensor([ 4.4160, -1.8578, -2.5718])

Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. | tensor([ 5.1687, -2.0352, -2.9725])
The role of a programming language can be described in two ways:\n\n   1. | tensor([ 4.8635, -1.9040, -2.8630])
It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks\n   2. | tensor([ 5.3107, -2.0455, -3.0804])
Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes. | tensor([ 5.6906, -2.1354, -3.2858])
\n\nAccording to the last statement, in programming we deal with two kind of things:\n\n    * data, representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate\n    * procedures, i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data. | tensor([ 4.7664, -1.8749, -2.8516])
\n\nAccording to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON, 1985, 4,])\n\n    ``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. | tensor([ 5.3046, -2.0127, -3.1169])
Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n\n    primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned\n\n    means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and\n\n    means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units. | tensor([ 5.2390, -2.0292, -3.0391])

To attempt know the mind of G-d is to be G-d, yet we are admonished when G-d responds to Job, not with an explanation for Job's suffering but rather with a question: Where was Job when G-d created the world?\n\nAnd it was said:\nJob 40 \n1 ¶ | tensor([ 3.4159, -1.8075, -2.1783])

I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. | tensor([ 5.1100, -1.9402, -3.0234])
A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. | tensor([ 5.5619, -2.1480, -3.1834])
For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. | tensor([ 5.5548, -2.1340, -3.2010])
Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. | tensor([ 5.4906, -2.0961, -3.1952])
When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn "incentivizes" people to answer questions. | tensor([ 5.3117, -2.0068, -3.1263])

For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. | tensor([ 5.4863, -2.0967, -3.1693])
Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. | tensor([ 5.4282, -2.0939, -3.1272])
Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. | tensor([ 5.5082, -2.1174, -3.1848])
The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now "secure enough" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. | tensor([ 4.4690, -1.8458, -2.6852])
Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or "encrypt" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. | tensor([ 5.2855, -2.0253, -3.0798])
Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. | tensor([ 5.3750, -2.0455, -3.1452])
The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. | tensor([ 5.4821, -2.1049, -3.1483])
However, the only truly secure network is the one never built! | tensor([ 5.1986, -2.0074, -3.0258])

It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). | tensor([ 4.1165, -1.7583, -2.5280])
But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship.\n\nAccording to a 1986 survey, more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. | tensor([ 4.2792, -1.9175, -2.4618])

Evolution is ever-present as always. | tensor([ 5.5331, -2.0887, -3.2055])
You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. | tensor([ 4.9381, -1.9419, -2.9060])
So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. | tensor([ 5.3705, -2.0589, -3.1293])
Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. | tensor([ 5.1716, -2.0030, -2.9926])
As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. | tensor([ 4.3166, -1.8135, -2.6192])

Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\n\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\n\nIs average height an example of this? | tensor([ 2.8208, -1.6984, -1.9077])

The answer, of course, varies for each individual depending on how fit you are, how often do you train and what your goals are. | tensor([ 5.5649, -2.1125, -3.2296])
\n\nIf you are very aggressive, you can do it in 28 weeks. | tensor([ 4.4622, -1.8949, -2.6397])
Start by walking, slowly, for a\nmile. | tensor([ 5.4595, -2.1699, -3.0835])
Two days later, walk 1.5 miles. | tensor([ 5.6688, -2.2182, -3.1798])
Every other day, increase the distance by half a mile until you get to 3 miles. | tensor([ 5.4604, -2.1296, -3.1211])
Rest your muscles on the "off" day. | tensor([ 4.6309, -2.0304, -2.5099])
Hold that distance on Tuesday and Thursday, while increasing by one additional mile on your weekend session (either Sat or Sun).\n\nOnce the long walk reaches 10 miles you can cut the distance in half every other weekend, increasing the long one by 2 miles each time. | tensor([ 5.6945, -2.2553, -3.1697])
When the long one\ngets to 18 miles, you can do it every third weekend, covering 8-9 miles on the "short" weekends.\n\nAfter about the third week of training, insert a one min jog into your runs, after 4 min of walking. | tensor([ 5.6444, -2.2482, -3.1473])
If this feels fine after 2 weeks, drop to 3walk/1jog. | tensor([ 5.5502, -2.1655, -3.1322])
After 3 more weeks, drop to 2-1. | tensor([ 5.6948, -2.1751, -3.2445])
If all goes well after another 3 weeks or so you could go to 1-1 during the week, and 2walk/1jog on the long run.\n\nFind the ratio that works best for you, that will leave you feeling strong at the end, and recovering fast from these long ones. | tensor([ 5.3511, -2.1285, -3.0061])

Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. | tensor([ 5.6532, -2.1896, -3.2124])
It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). | tensor([ 5.6274, -2.1825, -3.2200])
Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. | tensor([ 5.6294, -2.1659, -3.2302])
At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. | tensor([ 5.3175, -2.0396, -3.0762])
This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. | tensor([ 4.9095, -1.8933, -2.9380])
Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. | tensor([ 5.6669, -2.2037, -3.2051])

\n\nBasically, college grads earn twice as much money as high school grads. | tensor([ 4.6574, -1.9370, -2.6682])
This increased income provides more security, support to raise a family, and the means for furthering ones education.\n\n2) College grads have access to better jobs as many jobs require a college degree. | tensor([ 5.4349, -2.0955, -3.1401])

As a dutchman, and someone who's 6'4" I should be able to answer this one.\n\nSpecifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this, the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being "the tallest nation in the world".\n\nThe average dutchman is about 6'1" (4" taller than the avg american)\n\nResearch shows it to be a combo of genetics, disease prevention, diet (dairy, etc.) , average wealth & wellbeing, as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height.\n\nSo to summarize: drink your milk, get your shots, be happy and grow grow grow.. | tensor([ 3.6463, -1.9324, -2.1468])
oh and a bit of genetics.\n\nFrom a research report:\n\nGenetic factors are evident in marked regional differences between the north and the south of the Netherlands. | tensor([ 5.5885, -2.1205, -3.2600])
In the north, boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. | tensor([ 1.3442, -1.1339, -0.8880])
The populations are relatively stable, and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian, whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. | tensor([ 4.0350, -1.7211, -2.4799])
However, although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch, they are taller than in their countries of origin. | tensor([ 3.6213, -1.7351, -2.3587])
Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch, the world's highest consumers of dairy products. | tensor([ 4.9718, -1.9580, -2.9233])
Fredriks, one of the researchers in the recent study, emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example, the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children.\n\nLastly it's the healthcare system and wealth, every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. | tensor([-0.3922, -0.4943,  1.8000])

There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. | tensor([ 5.0203, -1.9896, -2.9082])
Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. | tensor([ 5.1727, -1.9629, -3.0514])
But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. | tensor([ 4.5499, -1.8572, -2.7350])
What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. | tensor([ 3.2986, -1.7414, -2.1825])
He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. | tensor([ 3.9251, -1.7716, -2.4316])

I would advise trying the strips (making sure to abide by the time guidelines) - you will like the effects of them (they do really work) and if they don't bother your teeth/gums, you should be able to continue use. | tensor([ 4.7626, -1.9597, -2.7465])
Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:\n\nWhen you think a stock is going to go down... | tensor([ 3.8972, -1.8124, -2.3760])
You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker.\n2. | tensor([ 4.9719, -1.9339, -2.8908])
You sell those shares at today's price.\n3. | tensor([ 4.8620, -1.8982, -2.8284])
You wait for the stock to go down.\n4. | tensor([ 4.3530, -1.8228, -2.5642])
You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.\n5. | tensor([ 4.9459, -1.9296, -2.8761])
You return the borrowed shares.\n6. | tensor([ 4.7336, -1.8625, -2.7737])
You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.\nSteps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.\n\nThe advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down. | tensor([ 5.0850, -2.0035, -2.9300])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
(With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)\n\nThe disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money. | tensor([ 4.7452, -1.9383, -2.7084])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment. | tensor([ 5.0378, -1.9618, -2.9380])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])

There are several means of successfully treating malaria if contracted, yet malaria is still one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developing world. | tensor([ 4.9039, -1.9506, -2.8363])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
The reason is that most of these people are too poor to afford even basic preventative measures like bednets (which keeps malarial misquitoes from biting children in their sleep).\n\nBednets are important step to reducing the impact of malaria, because it is much more expensive to treat malaria once it is contracted than it is to prevent it via bednets, removing standing water, etc.\n\nThere are some efforts to find cheaper alternative treatments as well, including one promising one that comes from Chinese herbal medicine. | tensor([ 3.4219, -1.8563, -2.0465])

According to this page in the French wikipedia, Reinhard comes from Regin + Hard (strong advice as you mention)\n\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Renart\n\nInterestingly, the page goes on to say that the word "renard" (French for "fox") comes from Reinhard! | tensor([ 3.6782, -1.7370, -2.3241])
Reinhard was the name of the fox (originally "goupil" in French) in a famous story "Reynard the fox", but due to the popularity of the fox character, the French name for fox became "renard" instead of "goupil".\n\n"Reinhard  : Voir Renard pour le sens. | tensor([ 3.5725, -1.7876, -2.1819])

Answers to this question can vary greatly, but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation.   | tensor([ 5.5411, -2.1131, -3.2364])

As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\n\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high. | tensor([ 5.0758, -2.0102, -2.9457])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])

Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\n\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\n\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\n\nwhere | tensor([ 4.8635, -1.9414, -2.8329])
N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year. | tensor([ 3.6496, -1.8019, -2.3041])
 \n\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\n\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\n\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year. | tensor([ 4.7466, -1.9290, -2.7649])

In the early 20th century, the instrument's name was often rendered as "ukelele", a spelling still used in Great Britain. | tensor([ 5.2526, -2.0512, -3.0402])

The 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. | tensor([ 4.0740, -1.8370, -2.4525])
These pandemics killed scores of people. | tensor([ 3.5343, -1.7926, -2.2864])
The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. | tensor([ 4.7608, -1.9241, -2.7940])
Like last year, vaccines for "regular" human flu are in short supply as well.\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you're just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. | tensor([ 4.3845, -1.9003, -2.5345])
When the flu strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them. | tensor([ 3.1395, -1.8958, -1.8835])
To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the "implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention".\n\nIn other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. \n\nEach learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. | tensor([ 5.1573, -2.0080, -3.0191])
And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. | tensor([ 5.1220, -1.9402, -3.0396])
\n\nThe NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student.\n\nOne of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. | tensor([ 4.8934, -1.9277, -2.9047])
This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. | tensor([ 5.6967, -2.1936, -3.2392])
Many learners have shown they can grasp concepts better and have greater success through experiential learning instead of the traditional textbook/lecture/text based learning.\n\nhope this helps! | tensor([ 5.3349, -2.0478, -3.1177])
Paraphrasing is when you put someone else's ideas in your own words. | tensor([ 4.6680, -1.8365, -2.8096])

Earlier when you did not have the router, were you entering the login/password to connect to internet? | tensor([ 5.0063, -1.9246, -2.9483])
If so, you have to configure your cable/dsl modem to host the login/password. | tensor([ 5.2143, -1.9875, -3.0534])
For SBC DSL modem you can do it by http://192.168.1.0/ and there is a option available in "advanced configuration" to do that.\n3. | tensor([ 5.6393, -2.1799, -3.2280])
Did you connect the ethernet cable from the cable/dsl modem to the \n    WAN port of the router?\n4. | tensor([ 5.3513, -2.0657, -3.0836])
Are you getting the Dynamic IP assigned by the router? | tensor([ 5.2659, -1.9809, -3.1186])
Check it by Start->Run->Cmd->ipconfig. | tensor([ 5.2168, -2.0030, -3.0493])

hi,\n\nThis question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. | tensor([ 4.9808, -1.9394, -2.9301])
I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. | tensor([ 5.2580, -2.0276, -3.0614])
To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. | tensor([ 5.5909, -2.1277, -3.2350])
\n\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\n\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\n\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. | tensor([ 5.0292, -1.9842, -2.9361])
it's not suprising. | tensor([ 5.1707, -1.9499, -3.0466])
they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. | tensor([ 4.8507, -1.8984, -2.8616])
that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\n\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. | tensor([ 5.4349, -2.0738, -3.1769])
this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. | tensor([ 4.7836, -1.8490, -2.8782])
one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. | tensor([ 5.1663, -1.9984, -3.0306])
a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\n\n4) accountability- | tensor([ 4.3853, -1.7885, -2.7018])
it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. | tensor([ 3.8872, -1.8632, -2.3291])
while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. | tensor([ 5.3364, -2.0169, -3.1359])
it's not. | tensor([ 3.9889, -1.7260, -2.4819])
the other factors are equally important, if not more so. | tensor([ 4.7783, -1.8351, -2.8880])
to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\n\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\n\nhope this helps? | tensor([ 3.2785, -1.7092, -2.1996])
Generally, film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious, but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes, too.\n\nNotorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. | tensor([ 4.7635, -1.8890, -2.8413])

How to restore 20/20 vision.\n\nExercise 1:  \nhold your index finger six inches from your nose. | tensor([ 4.8845, -2.1145, -2.6215])
look at it for 2 seconds then look at an object 20 feet away, and then look at your index finger again. | tensor([ 4.8383, -1.9594, -2.8125])
keep doing this for a few minutes.\n\nExercise 2:\nimagine you are looking at a giant clock. | tensor([ 5.0934, -2.0441, -2.8786])
raise your eyes to the ceiling to look at the 12 as far as they will go. hold them there for a few seconds then bring them back to the centre. | tensor([ 5.2196, -2.0515, -3.0134])
 then look at the 1 for a few seconds as far as your eyes will go and then back to the centre. | tensor([ 5.4163, -2.0544, -3.1681])
keep doing this until you look at all the numbers.\n\nExercise 3:\nlook at the imaginary giant clock again but this time instead of bringing your eyes back to the centre, move your eyes to the next digit on the clock and hold them at each number for a few seconds.\n\nRepeat exercises 2 and 3 but going counter-clockwise.\n\nWithin a few days you should 'see' a vast improvement (no pun intended). | tensor([ 5.0399, -2.0223, -2.8814])

The Earth is round because it is a large body, and gravity tends to make large bodies round because that is the gravitational efficient configuration for the matter to be in.\n\nThere are a few reasons you can encounter non-round bodies in space:\n\n1) the object is small (for example asteroids), so it's gravity has less say proportionally on the shape\n\n2) | tensor([ 5.1331, -2.0122, -2.9797])

"Phishing" generally refers to those e-mail messages that say they're from a bank (or eBay or PayPal or your ISP), but the links actually go to some other web site where the phisher (still pretending to be a bank) asks for your information, and will use it to steal your identity, money, etcetera.\n\n"Pharming" is another twist on the same thing, using more devious tricks. | tensor([ 3.4572, -1.7287, -2.2501])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
In phishing mail you can usually figure out that the site you're about to visit isn't really your bank. | tensor([ 4.2226, -1.7722, -2.5952])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
So for "pharming," they'll first trick you into running a program (see "trojans," "malware," "spyware," etcetera) that changes the way your computer looks up domain names. | tensor([ 3.7339, -1.7236, -2.4202])

As you may know, NQSO (non qualifying stock options) have tax withheld at source as soon as you exercise, so theoretically you don't have to pay any estimated tax on NQSO exercises/sales (although see * below).\n\nWith Incentive Stock Options (ISO) though, the situation is quite different.\n\nIt sounds like you plan to exercise and sell your ISOs on the same day. | tensor([ 5.1541, -1.9884, -3.0278])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
If so, then this is what's called a "disqualifying disposition". | tensor([ 3.9734, -1.7652, -2.4736])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price). | tensor([ 4.8508, -1.9076, -2.8321])
 \n\nIn general, the IRS wants you to pay tax in the quarter in which the related income is earned. | tensor([ 4.9817, -1.9077, -2.9295])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
So you theoretically should pay the estimated tax at your standard income tax rate in the same quarter you exercise and sell ISOs. | tensor([ 4.9864, -1.9274, -2.9384])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\n\n\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return. | tensor([ 5.2553, -2.0125, -3.0678])

Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000). | tensor([ 5.3733, -2.0711, -3.1018])

\n\n2.   | tensor([ 4.5845, -1.8810, -2.6000])
Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\n\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\n\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\n\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill. | tensor([ 4.5029, -1.8283, -2.6767])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\n\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000. | tensor([ 5.1467, -1.9956, -3.0023])
   | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\n\n\n\nClear? | tensor([ 4.5392, -1.8510, -2.6427])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
As mud?\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\n\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%). | tensor([ 3.5876, -1.7718, -2.2332])
 \n\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.   | tensor([ 4.3530, -1.8161, -2.5969])

Hence, a part-time MBA with no classroom-based activities will miss this important piece.\n\nIf you want to go for a fully remote-based degree, the Open university is a good option.\n\nColumbia also has a good option for a certificate: you keep taking several courses and after some time you can apply for a certificate in business excellence.\n\nI think both the part-time mba or the certificate are good options if you pick a good school.\n\nIf you can afford going to the campus about twice a month, an executive mba is the best option in my opinion. | tensor([ 5.3201, -2.0715, -3.0664])

AGP or Accelerated Graphics Port succeeded PCI or Peripheral Component Interconnect as a technology to connect graphics cards to a computer's motherboard. | tensor([ 5.5063, -2.1312, -3.1516])

Hitchcock directed, produced and wrote some of the greatest suspense films of all time. | tensor([ 4.9532, -1.9359, -2.8969])
His career spanned from the 1920's to the 1970's. | tensor([ 4.7282, -1.9196, -2.7756])
His classic films include "Psycho", "Rear Window", "Vertigo", "North by Northwest", and "The Birds". | tensor([ 3.4069, -1.7789, -2.1168])

The main advantage is that the compact crankset gearing is much closer to the high cadence riding that is the current trend in modern cycling. | tensor([ 5.6655, -2.2424, -3.1767])

With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.   | tensor([ 5.0034, -2.0832, -2.7993])
The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.   | tensor([ 5.4576, -2.2105, -3.0206])
The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\n\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.   | tensor([ 5.0979, -2.1031, -2.8386])
The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\n\nA couple things to consider, though.   | tensor([ 5.2195, -2.0706, -2.9747])

Stock option grants and stock grants are two forms of compensation often offered as incentives in addition to base salary offered to a newly hired employee. | tensor([ 5.3688, -2.0652, -3.1120])
This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. | tensor([ 5.2713, -2.0290, -3.0717])
\n\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. | tensor([ 5.5009, -2.1338, -3.1512])
The set price is called the strike price. | tensor([ 3.7466, -1.8863, -2.2730])

Employers grant call options to employees. | tensor([ 5.3646, -2.0482, -3.1364])
Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. | tensor([ 5.1803, -2.0129, -3.0147])
This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. | tensor([ 5.5849, -2.1644, -3.1887])
Let's say it's after four years now. | tensor([ 5.0452, -1.9661, -2.9480])
Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. | tensor([ 4.9269, -1.9426, -2.8633])
Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. | tensor([ 5.5335, -2.1539, -3.1541])
Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. | tensor([ 5.5609, -2.1622, -3.1794])
So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. | tensor([ 5.1787, -2.0067, -3.0138])
But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\n\nStock grants are simpler to understand. | tensor([ 5.1673, -1.9936, -3.0064])

Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. | tensor([ 4.8306, -1.9282, -2.7901])
Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. | tensor([ 5.3365, -2.0490, -3.0888])
At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\n\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. | tensor([ 5.6020, -2.1611, -3.2121])
That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. | tensor([ 5.0123, -1.9315, -2.9557])
A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. | tensor([ 5.2382, -2.0031, -3.0737])

FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. | tensor([ 4.3020, -1.8727, -2.4683])

Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles. | tensor([ 5.4730, -2.1960, -3.0410])

Knee to knee, and eye to eye. | tensor([ 4.5090, -2.0503, -2.4133])

Massage may also cause the body to produce fewer stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine (formerly adrenalin), and may also increase the body's production of pain-killing endorphins and the mood-altering hormone serotonin.\n\n  While seeing a professional massage therapist is relatively expensive, a friend or family member may be able to learn enough technique from a book or video to provide some relief for you. | tensor([ 4.9726, -2.0278, -2.8266])

There are at least 3 types of beta receptors in the body - beta 1, 2, and 3 - and they are sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine. | tensor([ 5.1988, -2.0438, -2.9997])
beta 1 controls heart rate and force of contraction in the heart (an increase in these will increase blood pressure, thus blocking them will lower blood pressure). | tensor([ 5.2446, -2.0859, -3.0066])
beta 2 controls smooth muscle many places in the body. | tensor([ 5.0289, -2.0258, -2.8848])

Oftentimes, we mean "An organized, militant Evangelical movement originating in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century in opposition to Protestant Liberalism and secularism, insisting on the inerrancy of Scripture." | tensor([ 4.0046, -1.7612, -2.4671])
\n\nBut the concept of fundamentalism can be extended to any ideology or theology whose tenents include a strict adherance to a code, especially one which demands the observance by persons who do not subscribe to that code.\n\nNaturally, this makes for a source of conflict. | tensor([ 4.7315, -1.8447, -2.8492])

Consequently, you have a moral obligation to prevent any person from doing that act - including people who do not think that act is wrong.\n\nAny critical examination of a dogmatic theology or ideology will reveal how necessary this is, yet any objective look at disparate cultures will reveal how subjective - and frightening - this can be.\n\nThe hope of the future is that fundamentalist evangelism will be enacted by appeal to reason rather than dictates of law. | tensor([ 3.8991, -1.7305, -2.4776])

A gas-operated firearm operates on a similar principle of a car engine. | tensor([ 4.9666, -2.0978, -2.7490])
When a round is fired, expanding gases propel the bullet out of the barrel, along with most of the gas. | tensor([ 4.8966, -2.0570, -2.7816])
But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. | tensor([ 4.8551, -2.0559, -2.7288])
A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. | tensor([ 4.5715, -1.9602, -2.6208])
When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. | tensor([ 4.8784, -2.0109, -2.7732])
The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. | tensor([ 4.8264, -2.0138, -2.7368])
the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight. | tensor([ 4.9144, -1.9941, -2.8232])

This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). | tensor([ 0.5536, -1.3452,  1.2185])
Drawing from the legacy of the Civil Rights movement, advocates of full inclusion for children with disabilities state that "Inclusion is the ultimate goal for all children with disabilities regardless of their disabilities or current placement" (New York State Education Department, cited in Shanker, 1993). | tensor([ 5.3651, -2.0307, -3.1638])
This is not without controversy. | tensor([ 4.9880, -1.8582, -3.0338])

At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\n\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. | tensor([ 5.2293, -1.9910, -3.0748])

Most likely inspired by the Latin square invention of Leonhard Euler, Garns added a third dimension (the regional restriction) to the mathematical construct and (unlike Euler) presented the creation as a puzzle, providing a partially-completed grid and requiring the solver to fill in the rest. | tensor([ 5.5631, -2.1566, -3.1736])
The puzzle was first published in New York by the specialist puzzle publisher Dell Magazines in its magazine Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games, under the title Number Place (which we can only assume Garns named it).\n\nIt was popularized by Nikoli in Japan, who gave it the current name of "Sudoku. | tensor([ 5.1457, -2.0104, -2.9986])

(if you trust the good folks at AcronymFinder.com). | tensor([ 4.3191, -1.7695, -2.6116])
Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. | tensor([ 5.5333, -2.1185, -3.2153])
As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. | tensor([ 4.9433, -1.8702, -2.9813])
Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. | tensor([ 5.4866, -2.0761, -3.2025])
Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a "feed").\n\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. | tensor([ 5.4390, -2.0764, -3.1620])
There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). | tensor([ 5.5722, -2.1364, -3.1996])
Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication "universe" right away. | tensor([ 5.5127, -2.1103, -3.1800])
Free readers are available as well; a search for "RSS Reader" at popular search sites will yield many results.\n\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). | tensor([ 5.5435, -2.1230, -3.2029])

Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. | tensor([ 5.5245, -2.1058, -3.1897])
The trade-off made is convenience for speed. | tensor([ 5.2982, -2.0298, -3.0867])
Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. | tensor([ 5.6833, -2.1892, -3.2285])
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. | tensor([ 5.6765, -2.2267, -3.2100])
Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. | tensor([ 5.6786, -2.1709, -3.2553])
Their work has yet to be completed. | tensor([ 5.1601, -1.9520, -3.0630])
The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. | tensor([ 5.3613, -2.0631, -3.1268])
Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. | tensor([ 5.3453, -2.0384, -3.1382])
Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. | tensor([ 5.6491, -2.1811, -3.2165])
Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. | tensor([ 5.5104, -2.0713, -3.2225])
These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. | tensor([ 4.4632, -1.8232, -2.6876])
If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. | tensor([ 5.1930, -1.9833, -3.0488])
This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. | tensor([ 5.5823, -2.1345, -3.2199])
The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. | tensor([ 5.5908, -2.1126, -3.2421])
This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. | tensor([ 5.5727, -2.1559, -3.1946])
Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. | tensor([ 5.6662, -2.1624, -3.2463])
The setup would most likely begin with a router. | tensor([ 5.3133, -2.0307, -3.1046])
This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. | tensor([ 5.3453, -2.0815, -3.0646])
There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. | tensor([ 4.9742, -1.9413, -2.9110])
These allow any wired device to be included on the network. | tensor([ 5.4925, -2.0983, -3.1707])
The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) | tensor([ 5.5048, -2.1141, -3.1924])
Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\n\n\nAdvantages/Conclusions\n\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. | tensor([ 5.5147, -2.1158, -3.1936])
It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. | tensor([ 5.5343, -2.1424, -3.1600])
Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. | tensor([ 4.8361, -1.9032, -2.8412])
If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. | tensor([ 5.5395, -2.1193, -3.1792])
The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. | tensor([ 5.6636, -2.1924, -3.2119])
Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. | tensor([ 5.3712, -2.0147, -3.1605])
Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. | tensor([ 5.6534, -2.1441, -3.2856])
Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. | tensor([ 5.6804, -2.2126, -3.2136])

Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. | tensor([ 3.7210, -1.7570, -2.3344])
Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). | tensor([ 4.1218, -1.8324, -2.4300])
The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. | tensor([ 4.4661, -1.8152, -2.6555])
We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. | tensor([ 5.0416, -1.9475, -2.9660])
It is contained in our mitochandria. | tensor([ 4.5501, -1.8582, -2.6739])
Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. | tensor([-1.3698, -1.5820,  3.5884])
The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. | tensor([ 3.8042, -1.8282, -2.2826])
So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. | tensor([ 4.2219, -1.7283, -2.6301])
Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. | tensor([ 5.4317, -2.0441, -3.1976])
Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. | tensor([ 5.3915, -2.0605, -3.1612])
So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. | tensor([ 0.8654, -0.6750, -0.5446])
These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. | tensor([ 3.9863, -1.7332, -2.4772])
Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. | tensor([ 5.1797, -1.9737, -3.0380])
Let me give you an example. | tensor([ 3.4302, -1.7918, -2.2727])
Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. | tensor([ 4.0181, -1.7685, -2.4971])
An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. | tensor([ 4.6186, -1.8420, -2.7522])
Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. | tensor([ 3.0131, -1.7021, -1.9993])
Others will not be so lucky. | tensor([ 3.4285, -1.7259, -2.2651])
If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. | tensor([ 2.7044, -1.7077, -1.8202])
The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. | tensor([ 5.2668, -2.0011, -3.1031])
If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. | tensor([ 1.7254, -1.2048, -1.1590])
More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. | tensor([ 4.8643, -1.8804, -2.8945])
From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are. | tensor([ 5.4878, -2.1027, -3.1912])

"Mikołaj Kopernik (February 19, 1473–May 24, 1543), more commonly known by the Latin form Nicolaus Copernicus, was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and economist, mainly remembered for developing a scientifically useful heliocentric (Sun-centered) theory of the solar system. | tensor([ 5.5143, -2.1163, -3.1985])

Passion\n\nI've received the question about motivation to workout several times. | tensor([ 5.4340, -2.0834, -3.1306])
A bit back, I emailed a fellow who simply wished the question of motivation could be answered.\n\nI think the 2 most frequently asked questions that I address in my Beginners' Guide to Fitness and Bodybuilding are:\n\n1) | tensor([ 5.3359, -2.0569, -3.0776])
How do I get motivated?\n2) | tensor([ 4.5194, -1.8936, -2.6299])
How soon can I expect to see results?\n\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\n\nPassion\n\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\n\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. | tensor([ 5.3537, -2.0684, -3.1026])
Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. | tensor([ 5.4527, -2.0863, -3.1667])
Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\n\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. | tensor([ 4.3222, -1.7770, -2.6133])
It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. | tensor([ 4.6679, -1.8348, -2.8038])
Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. | tensor([ 5.1878, -2.0003, -3.0287])
So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. | tensor([ 4.2204, -1.8038, -2.5454])
Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. | tensor([ 5.1730, -2.0316, -2.9982])
In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\n\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out. | tensor([ 4.6739, -1.8629, -2.7648])
You can be very successful just doing 45 minutes a session, 3 times a week. | tensor([ 5.6100, -2.2011, -3.1780])

It may actually hurt you FICO score.\n\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. | tensor([ 5.2658, -2.0314, -3.0590])
So, let's take a look at an example:\n\n$200 total credit available\n$175 total credit used\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\n\n$5000 total credit available\n$1000 total credit used\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\n\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. | tensor([ 4.9128, -2.0016, -2.8261])
Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\n\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. | tensor([ 4.4519, -1.8442, -2.6414])

It’s not how much of a limit you have that’s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you’re | tensor([ 4.2327, -1.8123, -2.5502])
using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. | tensor([ 5.0435, -1.9371, -2.9798])
To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you’re likely to just cancel it. | tensor([ 4.5823, -1.8449, -2.7037])
Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you’re worth.\n\nHope this helps. | tensor([ 3.0296, -1.7754, -1.9979])

I've lost right at 150 lbs. | tensor([ 5.0378, -2.0566, -2.8452])
& I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :) | tensor([ 5.5676, -2.1505, -3.1772])
\n\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. | tensor([ 3.4846, -1.7529, -2.2268])
He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity... | tensor([ 4.2019, -1.8063, -2.5115])
don't know why. | tensor([ 4.4993, -1.8254, -2.6865])
Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. | tensor([ 4.3063, -1.8468, -2.5592])
Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of "bad nasties". | tensor([ 3.9677, -1.8253, -2.3359])
I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store... | tensor([ 4.8650, -2.0448, -2.7105])
Victoria's Secret, to be exact. | tensor([ 4.7235, -1.8421, -2.8335])
My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. | tensor([ 3.5604, -1.7884, -2.3044])
He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. | tensor([ 5.3694, -2.0971, -3.0598])
It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. | tensor([ 3.4916, -1.7289, -2.2556])
But it just hit me oddly. | tensor([ 4.7966, -1.9321, -2.7844])
I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it... | tensor([ 5.2821, -2.0781, -3.0116])
that's what started the whole process. | tensor([ 4.5549, -1.8950, -2.6744])
By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. | tensor([ 5.4173, -2.1900, -2.9837])
I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. | tensor([ 3.8765, -1.9177, -2.2280])
Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. | tensor([ 4.0568, -1.9103, -2.3081])
So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want... | tensor([ 4.6106, -2.0302, -2.4488])
I'm not kidding. | tensor([ 3.9431, -1.8128, -2.3764])
True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating | tensor([ 5.2702, -2.0934, -2.9670])
but I also don't beat myself up about it. | tensor([ 3.8978, -1.8257, -2.3829])
If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. | tensor([ 5.2152, -2.1305, -2.8541])
When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. | tensor([ 5.6292, -2.2658, -3.0791])
The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. | tensor([ 4.6735, -1.9877, -2.5790])
I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. | tensor([ 4.6847, -1.9955, -2.6119])
As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. | tensor([ 5.2243, -2.1573, -2.8655])
So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. | tensor([ 5.4371, -2.2311, -2.9530])
Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) | tensor([ 5.0502, -2.0866, -2.7969])
I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes | tensor([ 3.6343, -1.7391, -2.3112])
where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. | tensor([ 5.1782, -2.1206, -2.8409])
I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. | tensor([ 4.4265, -2.1723, -2.2118])
I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages... | tensor([ 4.3312, -1.9728, -2.3642])
OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. | tensor([ 3.1601, -1.7905, -1.9862])
It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! | tensor([ 4.6529, -2.0470, -2.5191])
But you know what? | tensor([ 3.6483, -1.7540, -2.3863])
I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! | tensor([ 5.1816, -2.0411, -2.9542])
That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all | tensor([ 4.4091, -1.8290, -2.6312])
you should be able to access your pop account through webmail. | tensor([ 5.4791, -2.1183, -3.1481])
if you have your own domain, you should be able to access a control panel where you can check webmail through programs like Horde and squirrelmail.\n\nif it is a work account, talk to a tech person at your work to find out how you can access the account using a browser.\n\nmost ISPs (earthlink, verizon) also have webmail features. | tensor([ 5.2664, -2.0045, -3.1041])
call tech support or visit the company site to find out how. | tensor([ 5.5489, -2.1171, -3.2220])
Find you a copy of "Genki - An integrated course in Elementary Japanese" published by The Japan Times. | tensor([ 4.2978, -1.8338, -2.5337])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
It's the best introduction to the language that I've found. | tensor([ 5.3056, -2.0283, -3.1077])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
You may be able to find one at your local library. | tensor([ 5.5720, -2.1459, -3.1915])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
If not, take a look at TheJapanShop.net or Amazon.com or JList.com | tensor([ 5.1671, -1.9717, -3.0138])
I wouldn't recommend that you do that. | tensor([ 4.5138, -1.8097, -2.7043])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about "learning" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think. | tensor([ 3.9985, -1.7475, -2.4799])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used. | tensor([ 4.2809, -1.8343, -2.5477])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language). | tensor([ 3.2623, -1.6409, -2.0726])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. | tensor([ 4.6277, -1.8680, -2.7396])
Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. | tensor([ 5.3907, -2.1329, -3.0608])

unless the cracking is painful, it is not unusual or dangerous for your knees to "crack".\n\nLunges are excellent for strengthening the muscles around the knee joint. | tensor([ 5.0770, -2.0306, -2.9040])

This has an obvious answer, in a covalent bond, each atom contributes an electron & in turn shares the other electron contributed by other atom. | tensor([ 4.9035, -1.9073, -2.8729])

Half-staff or half-mast describes the act of flying a flag approximately halfway up a flagpole (though anywhere from one-third to two-thirds of the way up the flagpole is acceptable). | tensor([ 5.2818, -2.0738, -3.0275])
This is done in many countries as a symbol of respect, mourning, or distress.\n\nWhen hoisting a flag that is to be displayed at half-staff, it should be hoisted to full staff for an instant, then lowered to half-staff. | tensor([ 4.6093, -1.8573, -2.7190])
Likewise when it is lowered at the end of the day, it is to be hoisted to full staff for an instant, and then lowered.\n\nThe original flag 'etiquette' was to fly the flag at one flag's depth from the top of the hoist. | tensor([ 3.9404, -1.8427, -2.3381])
With the larger flags on shorter hoists on public buildings the practice of 'half-mast' has now commonly become to fly the flag at true 'half-mast' regardless of the size of the flag or hoist. | tensor([ 3.0049, -1.7423, -2.0054])

  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.   | tensor([-2.2186, -1.6330,  4.1990])
Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice. | tensor([ 1.4029, -0.8824, -0.9318])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called "faith" and the controlling of culture through that so-called "faith"...thereby falling into suspicion of "satanic" influences. | tensor([ 0.6431, -0.1524, -0.7888])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\n\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.   | tensor([ 3.3318, -1.9004, -2.0671])

DVD-R (pronounced "DVD dash R") and DVD+R (pronounced "DVD plus R") are nearly identical formats. | tensor([ 5.2358, -2.0111, -3.0355])
The discs look the same and are both supported by most DVD-ROM drives and DVD burners. | tensor([ 5.2051, -2.0222, -3.0036])
The only difference between the formats is the way they determine the location of the laser beam on the disc. | tensor([ 5.2617, -1.9943, -3.0810])
DVD-R discs use tiny marks along the grooves in the discs, called land prepits, to determine the laser position. | tensor([ 5.1848, -2.0345, -2.9926])
DVD+R discs do not have land prepits, but instead measure the "wobble frequency" as the laser moves toward the outside of the disc.\n\nThe DVD-R format was developed by Pioneer and was released in the second half of 1997. | tensor([ 5.3628, -2.0735, -3.0877])
DVD+R was developed by Sony and Philips and was introduced in 2002. | tensor([ 5.6020, -2.1600, -3.1920])
Companies that support DVD-R include Pioneer, Toshiba, Hitachi, and Panasonic, while companies that support DVD+R include Sony, Philips, Hewlett-Packard, Ricoh, and Yamaha.\n\nHowever, most of these companies now develop hybrid DVD drives that support both DVD-R and DVD+R formats. | tensor([ 5.4374, -2.0923, -3.1298])
They are known as DVD±R or DVD±RW drives. | tensor([ 4.9283, -1.9224, -2.8664])

If you have a DVD±R drive, you can use either format. | tensor([ 5.3351, -2.0296, -3.0852])
DVD-R is still more popular than DVD+R, but since they are both widely supported, it should not matter which format you choose. | tensor([ 5.4256, -2.0573, -3.1354])

A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a "pure" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned. | tensor([ 5.5636, -2.1796, -3.1586])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once. | tensor([ 5.3112, -2.0535, -3.0922])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance. | tensor([ 5.6105, -2.1939, -3.1831])
  | tensor([ 4.3932, -1.8622, -2.4719])
That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells). | tensor([ 5.0879, -2.0564, -2.8850])

Well, "assalmualaykum" is meant for greeting and saying "good bye" only from Muslims to Muslims.\n\nIf you are greeting an Arab, unsure of his/her religion, you could say "Ahlan wa sahlan" (Ah-lunn wah-sah-lunn). | tensor([-2.3839, -1.6294,  4.2915])

Ecotourism is loosely defined as nature-based tourist experiences, whereby visitors travel to regions for the sole purpose of appreciating their natural beauty.\n\nHard ecotourism is intense sometimes strenuous ecotourism that may involve non-hotel accommodations. | tensor([ 5.2843, -2.0353, -3.0771])
It tends toward longer, specialized trips by small groups within a wilderness or semi-wilderness setting mediated by minimal services; also called active, deep or eco-specialist ecotourism, this constitutes only a very small portion of the total ecotourism sector.\n\nSoft ecotourism is the most common form, where tourists hope to observe nature and culture closely, but casually. | tensor([ 5.2801, -2.0264, -3.0828])
It is technically defined as ecotourism that tends toward shorter, multi-purpose trips within well-serviced areas frequented by large numbers of ecotourists; also called passive, shallow or popular or eco-generalist ecotourism, this accounts for most ecotourism activity. | tensor([ 3.9280, -1.7673, -2.4304])

Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. | tensor([ 5.6466, -2.2180, -3.1755])
Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\n\nTime is often referred to as the "fourth dimension". | tensor([ 5.4573, -2.1173, -3.1393])
It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. | tensor([ 5.6487, -2.1766, -3.2157])
It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. | tensor([ 5.6324, -2.1519, -3.2164])
The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\n\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. | tensor([ 5.1176, -2.0241, -2.9443])
As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size. | tensor([ 5.4275, -2.0989, -3.1232])
