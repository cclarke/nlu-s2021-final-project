The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. | tensor([ 7.6537, -1.8204, -2.6944, -1.5138, -0.3047, -1.6833, -1.7690, -0.4142])
Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 8.4417, -2.5205, -2.2021, -1.8336, -0.8960, -1.9722, -0.8816, -1.1301])
 \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. | tensor([ 8.1559, -1.9410, -2.5070, -0.8511, -0.5855, -1.9049, -1.3661, -1.3868])
 Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. | tensor([ 8.3450, -2.4377, -2.5685, -1.2134, -0.5964, -2.3257, -0.9977, -1.0093])

Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. | tensor([ 0.4652,  0.3954, -2.1402, -1.6563,  7.6289, -1.9489, -1.8145, -0.4546])
The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises "bad" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. | tensor([ 1.8259,  6.3380, -1.7770, -0.4477,  0.6119, -1.2955, -2.1096, -1.3448])
\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. | tensor([ 2.2004,  0.3389, -2.6128, -2.3347,  7.6056, -1.7282, -2.4143, -0.9241])

It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "fight or flight" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. | tensor([ 2.3686,  0.5320, -2.8173,  0.0230,  4.9915, -2.2488, -2.8327,  0.1034])

As a result of the "fight or flight" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. | tensor([ 7.6921, -2.5023, -2.3939, -2.6005, -0.4888,  0.9060, -1.7142, -1.0810])
\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. | tensor([ 4.2273, -0.3955, -3.4577,  2.1082,  1.2637, -1.8015, -2.7454, -0.2046])

If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you. | tensor([ 7.9531, -2.4202, -2.3489, -0.7836, -0.5549, -2.5140, -0.9824, -0.8293])

The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. | tensor([ 8.1743, -1.6809, -2.2722, -2.3041, -1.0687, -1.0582, -1.0939, -0.8444])

As fossil fuel prices rise and technology improves so-called "alternative" energy sources become more cost effective, but the crossover point still appears to be several years in the future.\nForcing expensive alternative technologies on the market before they are economically viable simply raises electricity prices for homeowners--this is part of the reason CA electric rates were so far above the national average in the 1990's, opening the door for Enron and like to make their ill-fated arbitrage plays... | tensor([ 8.3242, -2.1658, -2.0642, -2.1522, -0.9716, -1.9777, -0.8790, -1.0309])

It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\nBrakes- | tensor([ 7.9493, -1.7008, -2.2406, -2.0804, -0.7248, -0.9922, -2.0613, -0.6465])

It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.   | tensor([ 8.3443, -1.3268, -2.5701, -1.4904, -0.7159, -2.4563, -1.7346, -0.7770])

There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\nNow, to get more generalized... | tensor([ 6.7120, -1.4852, -0.2299, -2.9237, -2.4569, -1.6253, -0.8421, -0.0435])

It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.   | tensor([ 8.5305, -2.1545, -2.1285, -2.1105, -0.6464, -1.9876, -1.6871, -0.7028])
Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on. | tensor([ 8.4754, -2.2485, -2.2439, -2.3953, -0.1439, -1.9613, -1.6193, -0.9122])

On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state. | tensor([ 8.1482, -2.7127, -2.1085, -1.0536, -0.4005, -2.1544, -1.1887, -1.3656])

With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals. | tensor([ 7.5979, -2.0543, -2.1011, -1.1354, -0.8738, -0.2757, -1.2109, -2.0150])

\nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.   | tensor([ 7.7176, -2.1221, -1.6431, -0.3417, -1.1768, -1.0743, -1.9038, -1.4485])

In the US, Trig is normally considered as a high school level course, however, it is not a required course to graduate. | tensor([ 8.2442, -1.5445, -2.3645, -2.0986, -0.3858, -2.1101, -2.4110,  0.2027])
I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.\nIn the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full "AP" Calculus, where the "AP" stands for "Advanced Placement" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College). | tensor([ 7.6076, -0.8462, -2.4226, -1.8837, -0.8452, -2.0599, -2.2506,  0.6972])
The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical.\n\nHere's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html\n\n"In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. | tensor([ 7.8957, -1.6172, -1.8086, -3.2034, -0.8485, -1.5621, -2.2181,  0.7168])
Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. | tensor([ 3.3797, -0.4482, -1.6647, -1.4523, -1.1149, -0.2483,  1.1471, -0.6310])
As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. | tensor([ 6.5871, -0.4644, -3.0692, -0.2750, -0.3821, -3.1684, -0.9698,  0.0850])

\n\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. | tensor([ 5.4396,  0.8305, -3.2880,  1.8085, -0.9486, -3.4704,  0.1359, -1.3602])
So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. | tensor([ 8.4373, -1.1108, -2.3405, -2.1599, -0.8062, -2.3259, -2.1044, -0.1253])
Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. | tensor([ 8.3007, -1.8852, -2.2469, -1.9280, -0.3579, -2.6925, -1.2243, -0.6621])

an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. | tensor([ 8.4576, -2.4553, -1.9772, -2.2653, -0.0655, -1.7574, -1.6653, -1.0966])

He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. | tensor([ 8.6533, -2.0800, -2.4117, -2.3686, -0.0702, -1.9248, -1.6056, -0.9898])
Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\n\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. | tensor([ 1.5152,  0.0665, -2.5782, -3.2974,  1.3767,  4.8002,  0.6086, -2.2355])

\n\n\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. | tensor([ 6.4450,  0.7757, -3.6737,  1.0944, -0.7556, -3.4621, -1.6649, -0.2693])

You might not have intended it, but your question is a lot more complex than you might have thought.   | tensor([ 8.5921, -2.3018, -2.0877, -2.2805, -0.4035, -2.0216, -1.7785, -0.6147])
It turns out that the temperature of the sun is a function of how deep into the sun you are, with the surface temperature being about 6000 Kelvins.   | tensor([ 8.4812, -1.5978, -2.0339, -1.9044, -0.7942, -2.4345, -1.8881, -0.6056])
To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins.\n\nThis fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.\n\nNow for the second part of your question:\n\nThe light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun. | tensor([ 8.0195, -2.1147, -1.9265, -1.6829, -0.9049, -2.1456, -1.0240, -0.8429])

The "heat" is another thing entirely, because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles, and photons don't count strictly in that definition.\n\nThere are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind, and around the region of the Earth, they have a "temperature" around 1000k. | tensor([ 7.3347, -2.1956, -1.0223, -2.0777, -0.9350, -1.1017, -1.1443, -1.1883])

so I think you gotta go with the guy who's performed better so far this year which is Delhomme. | tensor([ 8.5368, -2.5864, -2.0810, -2.1642, -0.3857, -1.5198, -1.5703, -1.0045])

Some bikes are set up more for racing, where you'll get a quicker handling bike, whereas others will handle a bit more laid back.\n\nParts wise, you'll find the same component offerings on many of the manufacturers out there for a given price point, as TaraN pointed out. | tensor([ 8.5322, -2.1188, -2.2514, -2.2226, -0.4691, -1.8589, -1.6019, -1.0251])
You'll most likely be getting a bike with Shimano componenets, with perhaps a mix of some of the manufacturer's own branded components (for example, Trek outfits their bikes with a lot of Bontrager componentry).\n\nFocus on the overall ride of the bike. | tensor([ 8.4777, -2.4392, -1.9884, -1.6447, -0.7091, -2.0458, -1.4505, -1.0135])

Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\n\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year. | tensor([ 7.5743, -0.9936, -1.9474, -2.7269, -1.6145, -2.0693, -0.3297, -0.5314])

I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\n\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious "soapbar" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then). | tensor([ 8.3717, -1.8823, -2.5057, -1.9108,  0.0378, -2.3775, -2.1657, -0.1750])

The only difference in the bikes up to the $1500 range is the shifters are usually a little better (they don't stretch as easily, which makes shifting cleaner for longer). | tensor([ 7.9481, -0.3899, -2.9658, -2.0301, -0.4961, -2.1602, -1.6024, -0.8740])

Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups.\n\nAlthough associated with a variety of ailments (some can be serious such as pneumonia or when harmful substances build up in the blood for example from kidney failure), hiccups are not serious and have no clear reason for occurring. | tensor([ 1.7140, -0.2741, -2.7077,  6.0168,  0.3596, -2.3624, -3.1270, -0.3614])

It's a recently developed concept of the general public categorizing information according to what's most useful for the masses, and is considered in opposition to the sometimes more formal classification systems created by an entity such as the Library of Congress or Yahoo!.\n\nFolksonomies are often implemented using tags.   | tensor([ 8.1426, -2.0115, -2.3499, -2.1534, -0.8470, -1.6461, -1.2215, -0.6977])
An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item, rather than having to decide which category to place the item in. | tensor([ 8.0777e+00, -2.2849e+00, -2.2980e+00, -2.4215e+00, -7.6483e-03,        -1.6116e+00, -1.4479e+00, -8.1057e-01])

It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or "snoop" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or "inject" unwelcome traffic as well. | tensor([ 8.3582, -2.4950, -2.0564, -1.6521, -0.7435, -2.3368, -1.4235, -0.6660])

For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. | tensor([ 8.1666, -2.1740, -2.1451, -1.7404, -0.4163, -1.8450, -1.5795, -0.9386])
Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. | tensor([ 7.9790, -2.3841, -2.2261, -1.4050, -0.6117, -1.9334, -1.3248, -0.8828])
Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. | tensor([ 8.4719, -2.2497, -2.3416, -1.9872, -0.3308, -2.3677, -1.2800, -0.7612])
The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now "secure enough" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. | tensor([ 7.5559, -3.0045, -2.1442, -1.9829, -0.7541, -1.1870, -0.6090, -0.4426])
Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or "encrypt" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. | tensor([ 8.2527, -2.4565, -2.2646, -2.3201, -0.5699, -1.7675, -1.1058, -0.7855])
Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. | tensor([ 8.2108, -2.2045, -2.5169, -2.1344, -0.0754, -2.2723, -1.3395, -0.8349])

\n\n3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching.\n\nOther factors, such as salary, affect attrition rates, but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies. | tensor([-0.8356,  3.8826, -3.2129, -1.5733,  4.5128, -2.4034,  0.6503,  0.4150])

 \n\nThere are also the old "standbys" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat). | tensor([ 6.8706, -1.4535, -3.0212,  1.2802, -0.8808, -2.6072, -1.9115, -0.5161])

This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process, and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position. | tensor([ 8.5118, -2.0804, -2.0749, -2.7221, -0.5183, -1.7364, -1.5720, -0.7560])

Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected, and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests.\n\nThe other factor is the overall job market. | tensor([ 8.4504, -2.0738, -2.3972, -2.3108, -0.2416, -1.8502, -1.1860, -1.2467])

This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash).\n\nUnless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area), you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%. | tensor([ 7.8687, -1.2640, -2.4333, -3.6561, -0.5595, -1.3193, -0.5103, -0.8366])

Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. | tensor([ 8.3794, -1.5742, -2.7886, -2.0105, -0.3282, -2.2909, -1.8602, -0.0534])
It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). | tensor([ 8.2993, -1.8135, -2.8195, -1.6481, -0.2614, -1.9835, -1.7569, -0.5284])
Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. | tensor([ 8.3804, -1.9005, -2.6999, -1.9300, -0.1916, -2.4262, -1.6693, -0.3506])

This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. | tensor([ 8.6186, -1.8674, -2.5240, -2.3541, -0.1757, -2.0131, -1.6856, -0.7745])
Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. | tensor([ 8.3066, -1.5996, -2.6334, -1.9023, -0.7171, -1.7429, -2.1363,  0.0249])

As a dutchman, and someone who's 6'4" I should be able to answer this one.\n\nSpecifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this, the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being "the tallest nation in the world".\n\nThe average dutchman is about 6'1" (4" taller than the avg american)\n\nResearch shows it to be a combo of genetics, disease prevention, diet (dairy, etc.) , average wealth & wellbeing, as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height.\n\nSo to summarize: drink your milk, get your shots, be happy and grow grow grow.. | tensor([ 7.9189, -1.0330, -2.7285, -1.6685, -0.2391, -1.7614, -1.9536, -0.8513])

Read the official FIFA interview with him at http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/gala.html\n\nAlso, TODAY (november 28, 2005), Ronaldinho is going to receive the "Ballon D'Or" (golden ball), prize created by the french magazine French Football --http://www.francefootball.fr/ -- in 1956 to distinguish the best player of the european leagues. | tensor([ 7.5265, -2.4320, -1.2427, -2.3582, -0.6318, -0.3041, -1.7039, -1.1191])

this is tough, since there are many players that could be the best at any time (henry, lampard, ronaldo, ronaldinho, zidane -getting older, though-, kaká, eto'o, ...). | tensor([ 8.0159, -2.5958, -2.2383, -1.4079, -0.2792, -1.6418, -1.9765, -0.4015])

I used Crest Whitestrips for a time, and they worked really well (I definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth).   | tensor([ 7.6422, -2.2405, -2.2713, -2.7661, -1.5845,  0.2726, -1.6553,  0.4294])
However, they irritated my gums to the point where my dentist told me to stop using them and they made my teeth super sensitive to cold and hot (i.e. eating ice cream or drinking tea was painful). | tensor([ 8.0993, -1.0182, -2.6747, -0.8004, -0.7407, -2.1322, -2.4275, -0.4686])

I would advise trying the strips (making sure to abide by the time guidelines) - you will like the effects of them (they do really work) and if they don't bother your teeth/gums, you should be able to continue use. | tensor([ 8.0093, -0.7812, -2.8561, -1.4840, -0.8222, -1.6376, -2.2623, -0.3451])
Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:\n\nWhen you think a stock is going to go down... | tensor([ 8.3473, -1.7343, -2.4403, -2.1550, -0.3429, -2.3175, -1.7775, -0.3924])

You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.\n5. | tensor([ 8.3600, -2.1006, -2.2647, -2.5692, -0.2412, -1.5291, -1.7093, -0.7032])
You return the borrowed shares.\n6. | tensor([ 8.2586, -2.1607, -2.2278, -2.6779, -0.4495, -1.3259, -1.4719, -0.8854])
You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.\nSteps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.\n\nThe advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down. | tensor([ 8.2178, -1.4548, -2.4089, -2.0895, -0.5665, -2.2180, -1.4048, -0.8984])

(With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)\n\nThe disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money. | tensor([ 8.2115, -1.6325, -2.2534, -2.2483, -0.5285, -1.8564, -1.7570, -0.5645])

The reason is that most of these people are too poor to afford even basic preventative measures like bednets (which keeps malarial misquitoes from biting children in their sleep).\n\nBednets are important step to reducing the impact of malaria, because it is much more expensive to treat malaria once it is contracted than it is to prevent it via bednets, removing standing water, etc.\n\nThere are some efforts to find cheaper alternative treatments as well, including one promising one that comes from Chinese herbal medicine. | tensor([ 3.1784, -3.0679,  1.4084, -0.6206, -3.5463,  2.7332, -0.1657, -1.8469])

Reinhard was the name of the fox (originally "goupil" in French) in a famous story "Reynard the fox", but due to the popularity of the fox character, the French name for fox became "renard" instead of "goupil".\n\n"Reinhard  : Voir Renard pour le sens. | tensor([ 7.8984, -2.7041, -1.7143, -0.1347, -0.8499, -2.7732, -1.1988, -1.3124])

As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\n\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high. | tensor([ 8.3953, -1.4340, -2.1890, -2.0537, -0.8224, -1.9635, -1.3658, -1.2096])

Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\n\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\n\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\n\nwhere | tensor([ 8.3247, -2.2942, -1.3534, -2.3512, -1.3171, -1.4057, -1.4114, -1.0103])

The bands are impressively big (for a party) like this year's Earth, Wind, and Fire (http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aq6jtr59klox), there is a huge variety of food and alcohol (including ice sculpture martini luges), and lots of other activities (gambling, full-body video games). | tensor([ 6.8798, -2.4088, -2.9080, -1.1635,  0.3730, -2.4694, -2.1284,  1.4047])

\n\nBut despite all that, your enjoyment will probably be determined more by how much you enjoy being around your co-workers (if they're going), your date, and/or how long you can enjoy gambling/dancing.\n\nThe last two parties really really impressed me, but I enjoyed the second one much more because my date | tensor([ 7.1717, -0.6837, -3.4980, -2.9549,  2.4529, -2.0692, -2.7913,  0.7859])

hi,\n\nThis question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. | tensor([ 8.4422, -1.7694, -2.0972, -2.5480, -0.7520, -1.9306, -1.6929, -0.3244])
I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. | tensor([ 8.4607, -1.7952, -2.3375, -2.8970, -0.4075, -1.9654, -1.7220, -0.0536])

\n\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\n\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\n\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. | tensor([ 2.4199,  1.0545, -2.9210, -2.2447,  1.3770, -2.2661,  1.4438,  0.5240])

that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\n\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. | tensor([ 7.4890, -1.6614, -1.8093, -3.5367, -0.7705, -1.8000, -0.8218,  0.5049])
this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. | tensor([ 7.5544, -1.4439, -2.8986, -3.1341, -0.4496, -1.9606, -1.3053,  1.0439])
one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. | tensor([ 4.9266, -0.5930, -2.4868, -2.8641, -1.8684, -1.0394,  0.5494,  2.6893])
a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\n\n4) accountability- | tensor([ 7.7171, -1.5053, -3.2607, -2.3087, -0.1712, -2.2301, -1.3404,  0.7708])

while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. | tensor([ 8.3696, -2.2180, -1.7695, -3.3756, -0.9291, -1.2200, -0.7796, -0.9419])

"Phishing" generally refers to those e-mail messages that say they're from a bank (or eBay or PayPal or your ISP), but the links actually go to some other web site where the phisher (still pretending to be a bank) asks for your information, and will use it to steal your identity, money, etcetera.\n\n"Pharming" is another twist on the same thing, using more devious tricks. | tensor([ 8.2928, -2.6268, -1.9784, -1.5125, -0.7133, -2.1445, -1.0147, -1.2079])

As mud?\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\n\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%). | tensor([ 8.2652, -1.9211, -2.3370, -2.3619, -0.5145, -1.9194, -1.3129, -0.7152])

But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. | tensor([ 7.4899, -2.2923, -1.6938, -3.3537, -0.6236, -1.7464, -1.6534,  1.2706])

It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\n\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. | tensor([ 8.4743, -1.8064, -2.5413, -2.2338, -0.5984, -2.1479, -1.4083, -0.4867])

Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. | tensor([ 8.3394, -2.3497, -2.2391, -2.2597, -0.4451, -1.5656, -1.3827, -0.9334])
The trade-off made is convenience for speed. | tensor([ 8.5450, -2.5594, -2.0067, -2.7941, -0.1477, -1.6378, -1.4645, -1.0594])
Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. | tensor([ 7.6563, -1.2971, -2.2044, -1.2676, -0.3851, -2.2045, -2.1476, -0.4896])
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. | tensor([ 8.5349, -1.6072, -2.5925, -2.3119, -0.0744, -2.4518, -1.6939, -0.5454])
Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. | tensor([ 8.3215, -2.3543, -1.9019, -2.4926, -0.3268, -1.5612, -1.4975, -1.0551])
Their work has yet to be completed. | tensor([ 8.5169, -2.5681, -1.3545, -2.8644, -0.5294, -1.5988, -1.3229, -1.2793])
The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. | tensor([ 8.5156, -2.0368, -2.3171, -2.6106, -0.0335, -2.1021, -1.8344, -0.4654])
Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. | tensor([ 8.2849, -2.3340, -2.0463, -1.9097, -0.5023, -1.9085, -1.3525, -1.2118])
Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. | tensor([ 8.5506, -2.4288, -2.0414, -2.4005, -0.3241, -1.9114, -1.3739, -1.1085])
Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. | tensor([ 8.4787, -2.2433, -2.2535, -2.5845, -0.1361, -2.4483, -0.9275, -0.9857])
These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. | tensor([ 8.3629, -2.2081, -2.2709, -2.7979,  0.0460, -1.7481, -1.4642, -0.8832])
If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. | tensor([ 8.3963, -2.8665, -1.7267, -2.5228, -0.9177, -1.6094, -0.4389, -1.5579])
This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. | tensor([ 8.5452, -2.3320, -2.2409, -2.4545, -0.0714, -2.0339, -1.4639, -0.9032])
The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. | tensor([ 8.6716, -2.1645, -2.1858, -2.5302, -0.3993, -2.2837, -1.1076, -0.9954])
This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. | tensor([ 8.5141, -1.9625, -2.4402, -1.9579, -0.4165, -2.1141, -1.8310, -0.6346])
Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. | tensor([ 8.5063, -2.2591, -2.2238, -2.5211,  0.0482, -2.1852, -1.4194, -0.8640])
The setup would most likely begin with a router. | tensor([ 8.3926, -2.7019, -2.1207, -2.4213,  0.1155, -2.1343, -1.3687, -0.8903])
This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. | tensor([ 8.4705, -2.2656, -2.1935, -2.5961, -0.2660, -1.6817, -1.7991, -0.6579])
There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. | tensor([ 8.3042, -2.6776, -2.0096, -1.8867, -0.2034, -1.8724, -1.6924, -0.8162])
These allow any wired device to be included on the network. | tensor([ 8.4233, -2.6064, -2.0492, -2.0991, -0.0555, -1.8398, -1.6717, -0.9952])
The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) | tensor([ 8.3840, -2.0988, -2.4209, -1.8702,  0.0272, -2.2045, -1.8836, -0.7275])
Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\n\n\nAdvantages/Conclusions\n\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. | tensor([ 8.4567, -2.4474, -2.2730, -2.0300, -0.1269, -2.0307, -1.6144, -0.8177])
It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. | tensor([ 8.3541, -2.1719, -2.3007, -1.9647, -0.3062, -1.6173, -1.7943, -0.9543])
Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. | tensor([ 8.4683, -2.5473, -1.8768, -2.3517, -0.5098, -1.8428, -1.6295, -0.6544])
If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. | tensor([ 8.5798, -2.1389, -2.2094, -2.6858, -0.3817, -2.2071, -1.3545, -0.4581])
The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. | tensor([ 8.4441, -2.3308, -2.1074, -2.3438, -0.1985, -1.8077, -1.7856, -0.8272])
Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. | tensor([ 8.4781, -2.4454, -1.8103, -2.5774, -0.5894, -2.1008, -1.5289, -0.4987])
Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. | tensor([ 8.5435, -2.2041, -1.7364, -2.5971, -0.8159, -1.7034, -1.7324, -0.6285])
Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. | tensor([ 8.1689, -1.6250, -2.5115, -2.0935, -0.1241, -2.1716, -2.2140, -0.1509])
Only then should 802.11n be considered. | tensor([ 8.5176, -1.9841, -2.3199, -2.7507, -0.0234, -2.0245, -2.0425, -0.1858])

Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. | tensor([ 8.5373, -2.2580, -2.1563, -2.3890, -0.2012, -1.8940, -1.7463, -0.8388])
Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). | tensor([ 7.7456, -2.4136, -0.8497, -1.7856, -2.2226, -0.5299, -1.2043, -1.1135])
The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. | tensor([ 8.4580, -2.3722, -1.9912, -2.2898, -0.3126, -1.7674, -1.3630, -1.1935])
We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. | tensor([ 8.1679, -2.2132, -1.9532, -2.3753, -0.6718, -0.6447, -2.0797, -0.8255])
It is contained in our mitochandria. | tensor([ 8.2021, -2.3416, -0.7195, -2.6510, -0.8652, -2.3592, -1.6350, -0.7024])
Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. | tensor([ 2.7627, -1.2092,  0.5060,  2.7016, -3.1149, -1.3944,  0.3634, -1.5382])
The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. | tensor([ 5.4615, -1.9511, -1.3179,  0.0989,  0.0880, -2.9361, -1.5076,  0.3237])
So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. | tensor([ 8.3750, -2.5438, -1.6809, -2.9194, -0.6409, -0.8123, -1.7821, -0.7682])
Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. | tensor([ 8.4768, -2.3555, -2.1948, -2.6455,  0.0825, -1.6734, -1.7829, -0.7255])
Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. | tensor([ 7.7149, -1.9553, -2.4293, -2.0920, -0.7188,  0.2159, -1.6304, -1.4816])
So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. | tensor([ 8.3423, -2.3532, -2.0960, -1.9809, -0.6718, -1.7639, -1.5079, -0.7054])
These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. | tensor([ 7.2207, -2.7268, -0.9553, -3.0917, -1.2634,  1.3246, -2.0828, -1.3375])
Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. | tensor([ 8.4558, -2.1991, -1.8904, -2.7325, -0.7037, -0.9928, -1.6398, -1.2062])
Let me give you an example. | tensor([ 8.4240, -2.2095, -2.2296, -2.5572, -0.2607, -1.6637, -1.9410, -0.3273])
Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. | tensor([ 8.3964, -2.1741, -1.9389, -1.6610, -1.3374, -2.1972, -1.4190, -0.6986])
An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. | tensor([ 7.7471, -2.2132, -1.5507, -1.6974, -1.5932, -1.8494, -2.0259,  0.2511])
Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. | tensor([ 7.1425, -2.1273, -1.6079, -1.1384, -1.4164, -1.2691, -1.9018, -0.3326])
Others will not be so lucky. | tensor([ 8.4125, -2.3076, -1.4920, -2.6517, -0.8532, -1.1276, -1.7895, -1.0100])
If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. | tensor([ 8.1587, -1.9572, -1.3636, -2.0786, -1.9840, -0.8191, -1.3246, -1.1161])
The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. | tensor([ 8.5285, -2.4142, -1.9922, -2.7243, -0.4568, -1.6748, -0.7599, -1.5623])
If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. | tensor([ 7.9689, -2.4328, -1.3244, -1.9403, -1.6430, -1.1703, -1.2302, -1.2511])
More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. | tensor([ 8.3041, -2.7289, -1.5237, -2.7687, -1.0677, -0.6956, -1.3140, -1.0825])
From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are. | tensor([ 8.2695, -1.7967, -1.7021, -2.5875, -1.0207, -0.8855, -1.7336, -1.3039])
i think you should go to google that is the best idea.or because it is a web site you can go there by writing www.sharesbears.com that can also help. | tensor([ 8.5274, -2.2147, -2.1101, -2.0871, -0.3624, -2.0696, -1.8196, -0.6123])

The Bermuda Triangle is a 1.5-million-square-mile (4,000,000 km²) area of ocean roughly defined by Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and the southern tip of Florida. | tensor([ 7.5041, -1.7651, -1.4227, -4.0477, -0.4054, -0.0705, -2.3410,  0.2666])

I would suggest conducting a search in your area for "technical temp agencies" or contacting a local employment recruiter to ask about technical temp agencies in your locale. | tensor([ 8.4438, -2.2186, -2.1705, -2.7915, -0.3186, -1.7134, -1.5567, -0.7271])

It may actually hurt you FICO score.\n\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. | tensor([ 8.5414, -2.5122, -2.0942, -2.5763, -0.2967, -1.8069, -1.4413, -0.7246])
So, let's take a look at an example:\n\n$200 total credit available\n$175 total credit used\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\n\n$5000 total credit available\n$1000 total credit used\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\n\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. | tensor([ 8.1996, -2.1530, -2.0850, -2.4852, -0.7659, -1.5766, -0.8842, -1.0702])
Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\n\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. | tensor([ 6.9768e+00, -2.1961e+00, -1.9443e+00, -1.7105e+00, -7.8200e-01,        -2.1025e+00, -4.4184e-03, -9.9408e-01])

using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. | tensor([ 8.2907, -1.8815, -2.5050, -1.9201, -0.2290, -2.4120, -0.8948, -1.1450])

don't know why. | tensor([ 8.1124, -1.9986, -2.0090, -2.5004, -0.2861, -0.9696, -2.7894,  0.1461])
Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. | tensor([ 7.9207, -0.4122, -2.0867, -2.6812, -0.4891, -1.5285, -3.1444,  0.3219])
Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of "bad nasties". | tensor([ 8.4912, -1.0726, -2.8315, -1.8958, -0.1008, -2.8710, -1.8455, -0.2424])
I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store... | tensor([ 6.7282, -2.0492, -1.8186, -2.7506, -2.0825,  1.8063, -1.5255,  0.1719])
Victoria's Secret, to be exact. | tensor([ 8.4043, -2.1657, -2.1255, -2.8248, -0.1694, -1.8672, -2.1322, -0.1371])
My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. | tensor([ 7.8737, -2.1634, -0.0342, -1.0603, -1.9679, -2.9432, -2.0682, -0.2597])
He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. | tensor([ 8.2218, -1.0010, -2.2662, -2.4449, -0.5897, -1.5642, -2.6953, -0.0791])
It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. | tensor([ 7.8848,  0.0840, -2.5275, -1.6718, -0.6066, -2.2274, -2.6771, -0.3847])
But it just hit me oddly. | tensor([ 7.9230, -1.7727, -2.5134, -2.4511,  0.0488, -2.0399, -2.8201,  1.1449])
I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it... | tensor([ 8.5927, -1.9983, -2.5327, -2.7908,  0.1424, -1.7417, -2.0192, -0.3483])
that's what started the whole process. | tensor([ 8.5055, -2.1131, -2.2405, -2.7559, -0.0948, -1.8545, -1.7694, -0.3304])
By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. | tensor([ 8.6614, -1.4916, -2.5428, -2.1279, -0.4457, -2.5538, -1.8463, -0.3633])
I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. | tensor([ 5.8727,  3.7899, -2.9511, -1.4791,  0.1711, -2.6496, -1.9240, -1.1657])
Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. | tensor([ 0.9956,  6.8860, -2.1202,  1.8973, -0.8250, -2.3898, -1.7485, -0.5439])
So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want... | tensor([ 8.3785, -1.6816, -2.6516, -2.2944, -0.0784, -2.0871, -2.0316, -0.2567])
I'm not kidding. | tensor([ 8.6282, -1.8649, -2.2438, -2.8442, -0.2398, -1.9339, -1.8891, -0.4234])
True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating | tensor([ 8.1862, -1.0412, -2.5146, -1.9326, -0.5009, -1.7665, -2.6316, -0.3555])
but I also don't beat myself up about it. | tensor([ 5.9170, -0.3807, -3.3029, -0.0455, -0.2922, -2.5596, -3.6063,  2.6534])
If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. | tensor([ 8.3242, -1.5995, -2.2476, -2.6483, -0.5936, -1.4344, -1.7265, -0.5915])
When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. | tensor([ 7.8690, -1.1355, -2.5260, -1.5844, -0.2256, -2.2798, -2.4056,  0.1158])
The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. | tensor([-0.8584, -1.3717,  4.9775,  0.7419, -0.3361, -1.1212, -0.9548, -1.5204])
I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. | tensor([ 2.5442,  4.7708, -2.8958, -0.4005,  0.5256, -3.4523, -2.7519,  2.6249])
As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. | tensor([ 7.5228,  0.6044, -2.2798, -1.6092, -0.9832, -2.1205, -2.5394, -0.3194])
So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. | tensor([ 7.3151,  0.6059, -2.8089, -2.4406,  0.7338, -2.4511, -2.9023,  0.0954])
Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) | tensor([ 8.3972, -1.0490, -2.6958, -1.9510, -0.6989, -2.2723, -2.1434, -0.1357])
I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes | tensor([ 8.2759, -1.3899, -2.8607, -2.4942,  0.6733, -2.2731, -2.1605, -0.2595])
where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. | tensor([ 3.4321,  4.2648, -2.4598,  1.0620,  1.1214, -2.7334, -3.0543, -0.2435])
I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. | tensor([ 7.3733,  1.2481, -2.4602, -3.2568, -0.2203, -0.7409, -2.4206, -0.8142])
I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages... | tensor([ 8.0718, -1.8200, -2.4938, -3.0059,  0.5443, -2.3388, -1.7184,  0.5561])

That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all | tensor([ 8.5957, -2.3949, -2.1911, -2.5568,  0.0758, -1.9810, -1.5671, -0.9891])

if you have your own domain, you should be able to access a control panel where you can check webmail through programs like Horde and squirrelmail.\n\nif it is a work account, talk to a tech person at your work to find out how you can access the account using a browser.\n\nmost ISPs (earthlink, verizon) also have webmail features. | tensor([ 8.4970, -2.3735, -2.1752, -2.2328, -0.4343, -1.8332, -1.2854, -1.1207])

A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about "learning" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think. | tensor([ 6.4116, -2.7031, -1.2963, -0.6901, -2.8451,  2.2256, -0.7595, -1.5507])

First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used. | tensor([ 5.1359, -1.5006,  0.4207, -2.0487, -2.3019,  1.8739, -2.5824, -0.1628])

Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language). | tensor([-0.7274, -3.6198,  5.3125, -1.9753, -1.7580,  3.6383, -1.8717, -0.5188])

Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. | tensor([ 5.4075, -3.0660, -0.0907, -1.4372, -2.3992,  3.0846, -2.0058, -0.9954])
Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. | tensor([ 6.2036, -0.0678, -2.4481,  1.3177, -1.9841, -1.7805, -2.5538,  0.0112])

Schools in the UK are generally called "Primary Schools" and "Secondary Schools" (which is the high school equivalent). | tensor([ 6.6325, -1.1844, -0.9735, -2.5890, -0.9267, -2.9961, -2.3517,  2.0923])
Some areas used to offer "Middle Schools" as well, but these have generally fallen out of favour.\n\nVarious types of secondary schools include, or have included Comprehensive, Grammar, and City Technology College. \n\nJust to confuse matters, we call private schools "public schools". | tensor([ 6.8465, -0.3403, -2.8803, -1.6320, -1.1767, -2.9833, -1.9904,  2.1558])

Half-staff or half-mast describes the act of flying a flag approximately halfway up a flagpole (though anywhere from one-third to two-thirds of the way up the flagpole is acceptable). | tensor([ 8.0392, -1.3298, -2.6806, -2.1567, -0.0711, -2.0872, -2.2342, -0.1874])
This is done in many countries as a symbol of respect, mourning, or distress.\n\nWhen hoisting a flag that is to be displayed at half-staff, it should be hoisted to full staff for an instant, then lowered to half-staff. | tensor([ 8.0592, -2.1239, -1.8962, -2.6781, -0.5989, -1.2297, -1.4989, -0.7705])
Likewise when it is lowered at the end of the day, it is to be hoisted to full staff for an instant, and then lowered.\n\nThe original flag 'etiquette' was to fly the flag at one flag's depth from the top of the hoist. | tensor([ 7.7752, -1.6539, -2.6866, -3.3389,  1.2295, -1.5437, -2.0258, -0.4222])
With the larger flags on shorter hoists on public buildings the practice of 'half-mast' has now commonly become to fly the flag at true 'half-mast' regardless of the size of the flag or hoist. | tensor([ 7.8992, -1.3736, -2.3541, -2.8765,  0.2615, -1.5251, -2.4738, -0.2972])

\nThe discovery of these new planet size objects including  2003 UB313 (nicknamed XENA), Sedna(in 2004) and Quaoar(in 2002 by the same team) have triggered a re-evaluation of the necessary criteria to call something a planet.\n\nIt is likely that this team at Caltech will  discover other objects to be added to the list of potential "planets" in our solar system.\n\n2003 UB313(nicknamed XENA unofficially) is larger than Pluto which leaves officials in a bit of dilemna. | tensor([ 8.5926, -1.6556, -2.2477, -2.4695, -0.7291, -1.9552, -1.3654, -0.8162])

Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called "faith" and the controlling of culture through that so-called "faith"...thereby falling into suspicion of "satanic" influences. | tensor([ 7.7980, -2.9229, -0.2888, -1.5210, -1.6185, -1.6894, -1.0677, -1.7477])

It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\n\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.   | tensor([ 7.7396, -2.7948, -0.8429, -1.4261, -1.3377, -1.5514, -1.2219, -1.4037])
