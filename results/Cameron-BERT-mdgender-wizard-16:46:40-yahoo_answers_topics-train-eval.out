Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([ 1.4879, -4.5857,  2.3224])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. | tensor([-3.2450, -2.8041,  5.5108])
Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([-1.1322, -4.0502,  4.1742])
 \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. | tensor([-2.7045, -3.5027,  5.4230])
 Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. | tensor([-3.0695, -3.1659,  5.7813])
When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly. | tensor([-2.4139, -3.6980,  5.5333])

Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. | tensor([-3.2566, -3.0448,  5.6671])
The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises "bad" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. | tensor([-3.3762, -3.0374,  5.8404])
\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. | tensor([-3.2065, -2.8139,  5.3565])
In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods. | tensor([-3.1210, -3.0464,  5.3923])

renting vs buying depends on your goals. | tensor([-2.1839, -3.6096,  5.1192])
<br />\ngenerally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. | tensor([-2.5743, -2.7497,  5.0442])
the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.\nhaving said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). | tensor([-1.8263, -2.7635,  3.6446])
it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.\nbottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. | tensor([-2.2564, -2.4455,  4.0912])

There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning. | tensor([-2.5719, -3.5840,  5.4657])
\nAfter turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles. | tensor([-3.1269, -3.2730,  5.8004])
\nUse the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys. \nDampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys. | tensor([-3.1376, -3.2597,  5.9006])

from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. | tensor([-1.3631, -2.0820,  2.1611])
It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "fight or flight" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. | tensor([-2.0276, -2.3588,  3.5089])
<br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. | tensor([ 1.2820, -2.9202,  0.4647])
As a result of the "fight or flight" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. | tensor([-2.8697, -3.2184,  5.4183])
\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. | tensor([-2.7286, -2.7876,  4.6905])
The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. | tensor([-1.7224, -0.4113,  1.6958])
\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. | tensor([ 4.0824, -4.2954, -0.4953])
So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness. | tensor([-2.3074,  4.1477, -2.0079])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
Everyone has different definition on what 'beauty' is. | tensor([-3.2608, -1.7893,  4.1019])

I like Lin Qingxia, but I think many girls are prettier than she was. | tensor([-2.9433,  4.6423, -1.7696])
(She is more than 40 years old now). | tensor([-3.4526,  5.2007, -1.7063])
"Lin Qingxia" is the most beautiful woman in the Chinese cinema, the most handsome man in Chinese cinema should be "Chin Han" because they always made movies together.\nHowever, A male movie star once was asked his girlfriend in real life or the girlfriend in movie is more beautiful.   | tensor([-3.5378, -1.0437,  4.0190])
He gave a very good answer: "I think my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world." | tensor([-3.1206, -2.0281,  5.1525])

Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film "Tango & Cash". | tensor([-2.2241, -1.5123,  3.9484])
After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. | tensor([-2.6868, -2.5311,  5.1006])
Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass, their conversation was as follows:\nGabriel Cash: I don't know about you, but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...\nRay | tensor([-0.3205, -1.1219,  2.1451])
What's F.U.B.A.R.?\nGabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition. | tensor([-1.0278,  1.1614,  0.4228])
A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. | tensor([-1.1008, -3.2845,  4.0578])
Since you asked "how the human species evolved? | tensor([-1.5814, -3.3451,  4.5085])
" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. | tensor([ 0.3293, -4.2384,  3.0865])
Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. | tensor([-1.3827, -3.5014,  3.7529])
The pressures for "fit" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). | tensor([ 4.9523, -4.1778, -1.5885])
These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology. | tensor([-0.5897, -3.7225,  3.3775])
That is kind of a tricky little quote. | tensor([-3.3423, -2.5469,  5.5631])
Sometimes placing it in context can help. | tensor([-1.8545, -1.5448,  3.8024])
This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self Reliance," which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). | tensor([-3.0734, -2.7116,  5.5705])
\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. | tensor([-2.6540, -1.8688,  4.1544])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the "independence of solitude"). | tensor([ 0.1066, -1.0650,  1.4224])
However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. | tensor([-2.4748, -2.1339,  4.0471])
Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a "finished man" can truly do. | tensor([-2.9756, -2.3967,  5.0221])
Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. | tensor([-3.3926, -2.5458,  5.1888])
So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced "perfect sweetness" comes in. | tensor([-3.0621,  4.5754, -1.2472])
When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. | tensor([-2.2686, -2.4862,  4.5020])

There are several websites that you can find rare or out of print books. | tensor([-0.6777,  2.3264, -2.4509])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
A couple would be alibris.com or abebooks.com. | tensor([-0.3108,  3.3302, -3.3092])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
These sites list books by booksellers all over the country and some internationally. | tensor([ 1.8256,  1.9889, -3.2563])
the most basic thing is to have someone you have a decent amount of trust for. | tensor([-1.6450, -2.0039,  3.1020])
someone recommended by a friend etc.\nthe things you have to look for are:<br />\n1. | tensor([-2.4897, -2.5027,  4.6056])
top priority is seeing that the broker can actually get your loan on time. | tensor([-2.1759, -3.3290,  5.1431])
many deals fall through b/c the broker cannot get the deal through on time and has less control than the original lender<br />\n2. | tensor([-2.2400, -2.9013,  4.9707])
secondary priority is to see that they have access to competitive rates. | tensor([-0.3581, -3.4574,  3.5534])
not all brokers have access to all sources and rates, although most of them will be similar.<br />\n3. | tensor([-1.7900, -2.7265,  4.3653])
you need to see that the broker is someone you trust to get you the best rate regardless of how much money they make off the transaction. | tensor([-1.4378, -2.5842,  3.8684])
Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD. | tensor([-1.9217, -2.1498,  3.8985])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you. | tensor([-2.3215, -2.5803,  4.1021])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.\nIf you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ . | tensor([-2.6506, -2.7029,  4.5269])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
This process is not very straightforward though.\nIf you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS. | tensor([-2.5699, -2.7489,  4.6265])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want. | tensor([-2.4107, -2.7477,  4.8544])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs. | tensor([-2.5398, -2.3333,  4.7527])
IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values, needs, etc.). | tensor([ 2.5491, -1.5687, -1.3408])
Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce, and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want, and you get an increasing percentage.\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.\nA parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life? | tensor([-1.8189, -2.4318,  3.5438])

Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number, as in i^2 = -1, where i is the imaginary number. | tensor([-2.7452, -3.4257,  5.6426])
You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 | tensor([-2.2525, -3.5673,  5.2619])
(that's the square root of -1).\nDon't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math, such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. | tensor([-2.6296, -3.2608,  5.0935])
The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones, it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :) | tensor([-3.1008, -3.0536,  5.6704])

There are some experiments where splitting entangled electrons allows us to observe some interesting 'action at a distance' effects, but the amount of data that would need to be stored to transmit something with as many atoms as a pizza is incredible.   | tensor([-2.5908, -3.1682,  4.9480])
Also, such an operation would require nano-assemblers that could interpret such data an reassemble the pizza from the info provided. | tensor([-2.2327, -3.0307,  4.7874])

The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions. | tensor([-2.1998, -3.5146,  5.3825])
The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. | tensor([-3.1826, -2.7820,  5.2615])
It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. | tensor([-3.2338, -2.7308,  5.2378])
Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in. | tensor([-3.0960, -2.4596,  4.6173])
Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). | tensor([-2.4872, -2.9757,  4.8989])
Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. | tensor([-2.9445, -2.8814,  5.4160])
Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. | tensor([-3.3818, -2.8234,  5.9287])
Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. | tensor([-2.8892, -2.5560,  4.5393])
If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. | tensor([-2.7402, -2.7761,  4.7633])
This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. | tensor([-3.0148, -2.6151,  5.1953])

I was put up there as a corporate apartment. | tensor([ 0.1561, -1.4897,  1.2182])
While it was fine, it was relatively expensive, and the rooms were small. | tensor([-2.2944, -1.9314,  4.3094])
It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. | tensor([-2.2566, -2.7490,  4.8980])
I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms, which are particularly American. | tensor([-0.1964, -2.3170,  2.7455])

With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals. | tensor([ 0.5181, -3.6165,  2.0117])

From my personal experience, I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects. | tensor([-0.7467,  4.2914, -3.1475])
\nMy mom's brother was the favorite- she was the least favored. | tensor([-1.3055,  0.6779,  0.3144])
50 years later, she still struggles with feeling inadequate and has a hard time trusting people. | tensor([-3.4795,  5.3294, -1.7463])
Because of this, she has a hard time maintaining friendships and family relationships.\nMy grandmother and her sister were treated differently by my great-grandfather. | tensor([-2.3757,  3.8424, -1.8886])
My grandmother was treated as the most special. | tensor([ 0.4669,  3.1961, -2.8025])
Her sister was expected to do chores, take care of the family etc. | tensor([-2.6575,  5.0331, -2.3337])
She ended up being the dependable, reliable one because she developed her independence. | tensor([-3.1406,  5.3545, -1.9411])
She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. | tensor([-3.2071,  5.4243, -1.9650])

To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins.\n\nThis fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.\n\nNow for the second part of your question:\n\nThe light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun. | tensor([-2.8081, -2.9509,  4.9864])

Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. | tensor([-2.2054, -3.4037,  5.1022])

Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n\n    primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned\n\n    means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and\n\n    means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units. | tensor([-2.9253, -2.9615,  5.2645])

I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. | tensor([-1.7082, -2.0276,  2.8046])
A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. | tensor([-2.1425, -3.3791,  4.5536])
For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. | tensor([-2.5567, -1.8666,  4.4467])
Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. | tensor([-1.6071, -2.4517,  3.3817])

Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. | tensor([-1.0535, -2.8541,  2.9922])

Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. | tensor([-1.8394, -3.5258,  4.7711])
It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). | tensor([-1.6170, -3.1010,  3.7147])
Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. | tensor([-2.7297, -3.0888,  4.9640])
At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. | tensor([-2.5891, -2.8572,  4.9390])
This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. | tensor([-2.2027, -3.0263,  4.5583])
Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. | tensor([-1.9377, -3.4403,  4.3710])

To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the "implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention".\n\nIn other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. \n\nEach learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. | tensor([ 3.7758, -2.0268, -2.5058])
And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. | tensor([ 3.9594, -2.8491, -1.4477])
\n\nThe NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student.\n\nOne of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. | tensor([ 4.8685, -2.2022, -3.1181])

hi,\n\nThis question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. | tensor([-0.0336, -1.8906,  2.1044])
I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. | tensor([ 5.0571, -1.9193, -3.0304])
To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. | tensor([ 4.4583, -0.7840, -3.0485])
\n\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\n\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\n\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. | tensor([ 4.8128, -1.6494, -3.3253])
it's not suprising. | tensor([-1.9497, -1.0944,  3.3535])
they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. | tensor([ 4.6524, -2.4685, -2.8227])
that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\n\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. | tensor([ 4.7794, -0.9453, -3.5296])
this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. | tensor([-2.5935, -3.3979,  5.2674])
one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. | tensor([ 3.2449,  0.4814, -2.8238])

it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. | tensor([ 3.7273, -0.4091, -2.5519])

it's not. | tensor([-1.5219, -1.3341,  3.2666])

The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\n\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.   | tensor([-3.2169, -3.1077,  6.0156])

This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. | tensor([-2.3324, -2.7675,  4.5786])
Let's say it's after four years now. | tensor([-1.5386, -0.7032,  2.6916])
Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. | tensor([-2.7846, -3.0102,  5.2213])
Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. | tensor([-2.8288, -2.8513,  5.3690])
Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. | tensor([-3.0457, -2.4903,  5.4124])

Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. | tensor([-1.8125, -2.6466,  4.0240])
At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\n\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. | tensor([-2.6096, -3.1296,  5.4357])

There are at least 3 types of beta receptors in the body - beta 1, 2, and 3 - and they are sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine. | tensor([-0.3734, -3.5306,  2.9283])

A gas-operated firearm operates on a similar principle of a car engine. | tensor([-3.1350, -3.1512,  5.9036])
When a round is fired, expanding gases propel the bullet out of the barrel, along with most of the gas. | tensor([-3.1046, -2.9193,  5.2939])
But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. | tensor([-2.8003, -3.1553,  5.3925])
A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. | tensor([-3.0860, -3.1375,  5.9116])
When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. | tensor([-3.0476, -3.2167,  5.7562])
The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. | tensor([-3.0876, -3.0823,  5.6523])
the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight. | tensor([-3.0714, -3.1875,  5.8414])

This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). | tensor([ 2.8106, -2.0727, -1.8225])

Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. | tensor([-0.1820, -3.1466,  2.5778])
The trade-off made is convenience for speed. | tensor([-2.7661, -3.1964,  5.5333])
Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. | tensor([-2.5992, -2.8330,  5.0045])
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. | tensor([-2.9542, -2.9958,  5.3963])
Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. | tensor([-2.1397, -3.3267,  4.8334])
Their work has yet to be completed. | tensor([ 1.0609, -4.4502,  2.4190])
The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. | tensor([-3.0365, -2.6979,  5.3672])
Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. | tensor([-2.6147, -2.9157,  4.8815])
Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. | tensor([-2.6511, -3.1697,  5.5304])
Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. | tensor([-2.6766, -2.9748,  5.1553])
These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. | tensor([-2.9494, -2.3456,  5.0774])
If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. | tensor([-2.7827, -2.7129,  4.7912])
This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. | tensor([-2.6950, -2.2881,  4.4743])
The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. | tensor([-2.1206, -1.9212,  3.6066])
This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. | tensor([-3.3557, -2.7758,  5.7627])
Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. | tensor([-2.4866, -2.6670,  4.7150])
The setup would most likely begin with a router. | tensor([-3.1904, -3.0744,  6.0807])
This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. | tensor([-2.3164, -3.0546,  5.3694])
There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. | tensor([-3.0672, -3.1663,  5.9687])
These allow any wired device to be included on the network. | tensor([-2.4280, -3.2173,  5.1592])
The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) | tensor([-2.5110, -2.9386,  4.9554])
Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\n\n\nAdvantages/Conclusions\n\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. | tensor([-2.5996, -3.1098,  4.9551])
It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. | tensor([-2.3500, -3.5930,  5.3822])
Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. | tensor([-2.9071, -2.9467,  5.4446])
If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. | tensor([-2.8252, -2.6556,  5.1567])
The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. | tensor([-0.9231, -2.9049,  2.9596])

Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. | tensor([-2.3605, -3.2065,  4.8943])
Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). | tensor([-2.7910, -2.3873,  4.4583])
The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. | tensor([-2.6182, -2.9096,  4.8645])
We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. | tensor([-1.5770, -3.4364,  4.3505])
It is contained in our mitochandria. | tensor([-2.3461, -2.9286,  4.8193])
Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. | tensor([-2.1754, -3.1854,  4.8128])
The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. | tensor([ 1.5472, -3.8725,  1.7814])
So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. | tensor([-1.9361, -3.1601,  4.1530])
Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. | tensor([-2.2195, -3.1871,  4.6096])
Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. | tensor([-0.8327, -3.2923,  3.4333])
So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. | tensor([-1.2462, -3.4441,  4.0621])
These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. | tensor([-1.2672, -3.4304,  3.4582])
Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. | tensor([-1.0252, -4.2353,  4.3811])
Let me give you an example. | tensor([-1.9463, -1.9227,  4.0053])
Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. | tensor([-2.6190, -2.6752,  4.8136])
An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. | tensor([-0.8476, -1.6017,  2.4044])
Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. | tensor([-0.7194, -1.7287,  2.3546])
Others will not be so lucky. | tensor([-1.3752, -2.2350,  3.4337])

The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. | tensor([-2.0843, -2.3214,  3.9038])
If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. | tensor([-0.4674, -1.3419,  1.8549])
More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. | tensor([ 0.1672, -3.0624,  2.2156])

How do I get motivated?\n2) | tensor([-3.1363, -3.1169,  5.8299])
How soon can I expect to see results?\n\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\n\nPassion\n\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\n\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. | tensor([-2.8317, -3.0375,  5.2550])
Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. | tensor([-3.1213, -2.8569,  5.3808])
Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\n\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. | tensor([-2.6889, -3.2246,  5.3009])
It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. | tensor([-1.5370, -2.9306,  4.0584])
Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. | tensor([-2.2920, -3.5870,  5.2169])
So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. | tensor([-0.9552, -3.2613,  3.3383])
Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. | tensor([-2.4988, -3.4709,  5.1835])

You might even consider having the credit limit taken up (but don’t max them out). | tensor([-3.0012, -2.7270,  5.4342])
It’s not how much of a limit you have that’s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you’re | tensor([-1.2410, -3.0158,  3.8961])
using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. | tensor([-1.4636, -2.7997,  3.4210])
To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you’re likely to just cancel it. | tensor([-1.6240, -1.9257,  3.5229])
Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you’re worth.\n\nHope this helps. | tensor([-2.6574, -2.6006,  4.6791])

& I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :) | tensor([-3.0265, -2.8840,  5.3837])
\n\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. | tensor([-2.3136, -0.9052,  2.7123])
He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity... | tensor([-2.0861, -2.1104,  3.7762])
don't know why. | tensor([-1.0233, -1.4790,  2.8732])
Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. | tensor([-3.1839, -2.9581,  5.7513])
Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of "bad nasties". | tensor([-2.5900, -2.0608,  4.2026])
I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store... | tensor([-0.8871, -1.5106,  1.8209])
Victoria's Secret, to be exact. | tensor([-2.6542,  5.1105, -2.0962])
My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. | tensor([-1.9091, -2.5743,  3.6911])
He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. | tensor([-3.0082, -2.5972,  4.9270])
It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. | tensor([-3.1133, -2.9705,  5.4497])
But it just hit me oddly. | tensor([-1.7510, -0.8957,  3.2680])
I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it... | tensor([-1.8853, -1.7839,  3.7918])
that's what started the whole process. | tensor([-1.8917, -1.4488,  3.6356])
By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. | tensor([-1.1175, -0.2888,  1.3477])
I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. | tensor([-1.6821, -2.8365,  4.0192])
Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. | tensor([ 0.7612, -2.1868,  1.4514])
So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want... | tensor([-1.2814, -1.2415,  2.9216])
I'm not kidding. | tensor([-1.5212, -1.5541,  3.5233])
True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating | tensor([ 5.3931, -3.7200, -1.9442])
but I also don't beat myself up about it. | tensor([-1.7148, -0.9831,  3.0631])
If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. | tensor([-0.7029, -4.5226,  4.5411])
When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. | tensor([ 5.4039, -3.2536, -3.0706])
The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. | tensor([-1.3856, -2.8356,  3.4542])
I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. | tensor([ 1.8423, -3.2135,  0.8618])
As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. | tensor([-3.2053, -3.1241,  5.8307])
So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. | tensor([-1.7241, -2.8271,  4.0478])
Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) | tensor([-2.6121, -0.2982,  2.0781])
I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes | tensor([-0.1942,  1.7600, -0.2145])
where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. | tensor([-3.0288, -2.8310,  5.4044])
I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. | tensor([-2.4363, -3.6663,  5.5507])
I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages... | tensor([-3.5545, -2.1165,  5.1107])

I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! | tensor([-2.3372, -1.9778,  3.6473])
That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all | tensor([-2.7054, -2.5346,  5.0023])

A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about "learning" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think. | tensor([-1.7791, -3.0083,  3.8942])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used. | tensor([-1.5883, -3.3682,  4.1731])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language). | tensor([-0.8321, -2.9982,  2.9115])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. | tensor([-2.0280, -2.4798,  3.4447])

A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a "pure" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned. | tensor([-3.0506, -2.9957,  5.6134])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once. | tensor([-2.5336, -3.0517,  5.1343])
  | tensor([-1.3204, -1.9213,  3.4049])
Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance. | tensor([-3.1380, -2.9835,  5.7252])

The wearer is unable to stand up straight (Cantos 10 through 12).\n    * Terrace 2: | tensor([-3.2394, -2.5982,  5.3256])
Envy, by having one's eyes sewn shut, and wearing clothing that makes the soul indistinguishable from the ground (Cantos 13 through 15).\n    * Terrace 3: Wrath, by walking around in acrid smoke (Cantos 15 through 17).\n    * Terrace 4: Sloth, by continually running (Cantos 18 and 19).\n    * Terrace 5: Avarice, by lying face-down on the ground (Cantos 19 through 21).\n    * Terrace 6: Gluttony, by abstaining from any food or drink (Cantos 22 through 24).\n    * Terrace 7: Lust, by burning in an immense wall of flames (Cantos 25 through 27)."(1) | tensor([-2.3872, -1.9956,  3.5318])
Well, "assalmualaykum" is meant for greeting and saying "good bye" only from Muslims to Muslims.\n\nIf you are greeting an Arab, unsure of his/her religion, you could say "Ahlan wa sahlan" (Ah-lunn wah-sah-lunn). | tensor([-1.3832, -1.8678,  2.8399])

Ecotourism is loosely defined as nature-based tourist experiences, whereby visitors travel to regions for the sole purpose of appreciating their natural beauty.\n\nHard ecotourism is intense sometimes strenuous ecotourism that may involve non-hotel accommodations. | tensor([-1.4415, -2.0992,  2.7459])
It tends toward longer, specialized trips by small groups within a wilderness or semi-wilderness setting mediated by minimal services; also called active, deep or eco-specialist ecotourism, this constitutes only a very small portion of the total ecotourism sector.\n\nSoft ecotourism is the most common form, where tourists hope to observe nature and culture closely, but casually. | tensor([-1.5935, -2.0210,  2.8784])
It is technically defined as ecotourism that tends toward shorter, multi-purpose trips within well-serviced areas frequented by large numbers of ecotourists; also called passive, shallow or popular or eco-generalist ecotourism, this accounts for most ecotourism activity. | tensor([-1.0418, -2.6582,  2.8050])

Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. | tensor([-3.1013, -3.1094,  5.6900])
Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\n\nTime is often referred to as the "fourth dimension". | tensor([-3.4265, -2.8909,  5.8682])
It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. | tensor([-3.3642, -2.7756,  5.7276])
It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. | tensor([-3.3340, -2.8053,  5.6447])
The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\n\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. | tensor([-3.1995, -2.9560,  5.5302])
As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size. | tensor([-3.2633, -2.7544,  5.4357])
