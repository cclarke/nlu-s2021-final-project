Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([-2.5029,  2.3879])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. | tensor([-4.5552,  4.0393])
Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. | tensor([-3.1118,  2.7667])
 \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. | tensor([-2.8541,  2.6137])
 Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. | tensor([-4.0420,  3.5157])
When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly. | tensor([-4.0245,  3.4712])

Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. | tensor([ 2.7260, -2.6707])
The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises "bad" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. | tensor([ 1.8737, -2.2150])
\nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. | tensor([ 2.9475, -2.7668])
In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods. | tensor([ 2.9807, -2.7838])

renting vs buying depends on your goals. | tensor([-5.0932,  4.7890])
<br />\ngenerally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. | tensor([-3.9009,  3.4280])
the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.\nhaving said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). | tensor([-4.0339,  3.5489])
it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.\nbottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. | tensor([-4.1115,  3.6325])
the other numbers tend to even out, the main gain or loss in buying comes from appreciation/depreciation. | tensor([-4.4530,  3.9615])
There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning. | tensor([-2.8461,  2.6044])
\nAfter turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles. | tensor([-4.3156,  3.8396])
\nUse the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys. \nDampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys. | tensor([-3.4773,  3.0610])
\nUse the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris. | tensor([-2.6106,  2.4957])
<br />\nIf | tensor([-4.3292,  3.8000])
you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. | tensor([-3.5303,  3.1104])

from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. | tensor([-3.3220,  2.9278])
It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "fight or flight" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. | tensor([-2.2717,  2.3159])
<br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. | tensor([ 3.0850, -2.8429])
As a result of the "fight or flight" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. | tensor([-4.4875,  4.0002])
\nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. | tensor([ 3.2797, -2.9392])
The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. | tensor([ 3.6882, -3.1672])
\nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. | tensor([ 4.3419, -3.8317])
So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness. | tensor([ 4.2898, -3.7398])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Everyone has different definition on what 'beauty' is. | tensor([ 3.8942, -3.3237])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
I like Lin Qingxia, but I think many girls are prettier than she was. | tensor([ 4.8326, -4.3908])
(She is more than 40 years old now). | tensor([ 4.9541, -4.6493])
"Lin Qingxia" is the most beautiful woman in the Chinese cinema, the most handsome man in Chinese cinema should be "Chin Han" because they always made movies together.\nHowever, A male movie star once was asked his girlfriend in real life or the girlfriend in movie is more beautiful.   | tensor([-2.5534,  2.1631])
He gave a very good answer: "I think my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world." | tensor([ 3.9367, -3.3998])
 :) | tensor([-5.0947,  4.7024])
Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film "Tango & Cash". | tensor([-3.8447,  3.3420])
After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. | tensor([-3.5206,  3.0722])
Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass, their conversation was as follows:\nGabriel Cash: I don't know about you, but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...\nRay | tensor([-2.9379,  2.7033])
What's F.U.B.A.R.?\nGabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition. | tensor([-3.2924,  2.9255])
A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. | tensor([-5.0576,  4.7206])
Since you asked "how the human species evolved? | tensor([-2.8249,  2.5806])
" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. | tensor([-3.3855,  3.0026])
Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. | tensor([-2.8051,  2.5905])
The pressures for "fit" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). | tensor([-3.4850,  3.0488])
These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology. | tensor([-4.6545,  4.1755])
That is kind of a tricky little quote. | tensor([-4.7658,  4.2507])
Sometimes placing it in context can help. | tensor([-3.6233,  3.0821])
This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self Reliance," which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). | tensor([-3.1948,  2.8462])
\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. | tensor([ 1.7103, -2.0025])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the "independence of solitude"). | tensor([-3.2195,  2.8726])
However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. | tensor([ 3.1252, -2.8374])
Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a "finished man" can truly do. | tensor([-5.1256,  4.8783])
Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. | tensor([-2.2190,  2.2290])
So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced "perfect sweetness" comes in. | tensor([ 4.8545, -4.4270])
When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. | tensor([-5.1002,  4.8022])
\nWhat do you think? | tensor([-3.9768,  3.4665])
There are several websites that you can find rare or out of print books. | tensor([ 2.8283, -2.7105])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
A couple would be alibris.com or abebooks.com. | tensor([-2.7502,  2.5261])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
These sites list books by booksellers all over the country and some internationally. | tensor([ 2.1643, -2.0713])
the most basic thing is to have someone you have a decent amount of trust for. | tensor([-2.9298,  2.6867])
someone recommended by a friend etc.\nthe things you have to look for are:<br />\n1. | tensor([-3.2225,  2.8725])
top priority is seeing that the broker can actually get your loan on time. | tensor([-5.0363,  4.6936])
many deals fall through b/c the broker cannot get the deal through on time and has less control than the original lender<br />\n2. | tensor([-4.7719,  4.3411])
secondary priority is to see that they have access to competitive rates. | tensor([-4.7101,  4.2667])
not all brokers have access to all sources and rates, although most of them will be similar.<br />\n3. | tensor([-4.6408,  4.1793])
you need to see that the broker is someone you trust to get you the best rate regardless of how much money they make off the transaction. | tensor([-5.0544,  4.7248])
Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD. | tensor([-4.5884,  4.1241])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you. | tensor([-3.9034,  3.4247])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.\nIf you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ . | tensor([-4.5519,  4.1022])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
This process is not very straightforward though.\nIf you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS. | tensor([-4.2234,  3.7403])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want. | tensor([-3.8564,  3.3827])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs. | tensor([-2.9718,  2.6818])
IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values, needs, etc.). | tensor([ 3.8603, -3.3090])
Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce, and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want, and you get an increasing percentage.\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.\nA parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life? | tensor([ 4.0138, -3.4545])

Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number, as in i^2 = -1, where i is the imaginary number. | tensor([-4.6404,  4.1587])
You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 | tensor([-3.9173,  3.3713])
(that's the square root of -1).\nDon't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math, such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. | tensor([-4.9423,  4.5522])
The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones, it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :) | tensor([-4.7021,  4.2461])

  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
As a result, the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades. | tensor([-5.1166,  4.8308])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions. | tensor([-5.1324,  4.9077])
The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. | tensor([-4.8213,  4.4085])
It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. | tensor([-4.4437,  3.9395])
Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in. | tensor([-3.9775,  3.4893])
Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). | tensor([-3.0462,  2.7545])
Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. | tensor([-3.7722,  3.3011])
Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. | tensor([-3.9476,  3.4422])
Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. | tensor([-3.8247,  3.3200])
If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. | tensor([-3.6151,  3.1407])
This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. | tensor([-4.0656,  3.5477])
For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium. | tensor([-3.6566,  3.2033])

I can't tell you which of the many are best, but I can tell you about one I lived in briefly.\nI lived for a month in the Avalon at 4th and King. | tensor([-2.7758,  2.6004])
I was put up there as a corporate apartment. | tensor([-3.3152,  2.9018])
While it was fine, it was relatively expensive, and the rooms were small. | tensor([-2.9875,  2.6579])
It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. | tensor([ 1.8420, -1.7050])
I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms, which are particularly American. | tensor([ 3.4811, -3.0261])

\nThe Avalon had a big gym, however, which was very good, and concierge service, which was very convenient. | tensor([-4.6824,  4.2447])
Most of them were very friendly. | tensor([ 3.4513, -3.0191])
One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!   | tensor([ 4.6472, -4.0902])
Also convenient was its proximity to the Caltrain, the Safeway across the street and the Starbucks. | tensor([-3.7602,  3.2507])
But if you crave culture, this ain't it: everything is a chain store nearby.\nSo depending on your budget, your need for convenience and culture, and your tolerance for small rooms and/or omnirooms, it may suit you. | tensor([-3.1810,  2.8491])

These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers. | tensor([-4.9502,  4.5183])

The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed. | tensor([-5.0746,  4.7121])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.   | tensor([-5.1117,  4.8338])
The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal | tensor([-4.7126,  4.2418])

The problem is that if the container shines, it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out. | tensor([-2.8231,  2.6068])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\nNow, to get more generalized... | tensor([-3.0492,  2.7515])
it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. | tensor([-2.1844,  2.0097])
Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam. | tensor([-3.3414,  2.9032])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place. | tensor([-4.6181,  4.1268])

Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way. | tensor([-3.7754,  3.2650])

Google's true competitor is often seen as being Microsoft, not Yahoo. | tensor([-2.3817,  2.2900])
This would support your claim that they are complementary. | tensor([ 2.9285, -2.7371])
It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.   | tensor([ 2.7814, -2.6287])
Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on. | tensor([ 2.7725, -2.6218])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state. | tensor([-2.1481,  1.9938])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals. | tensor([ 2.5548, -2.5276])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
\nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.   | tensor([-2.5659,  2.4928])
If this is so, then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses. | tensor([ 3.8632, -3.3051])
In the US, Trig is normally considered as a high school level course, however, it is not a required course to graduate. | tensor([-4.0169,  3.4935])
I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.\nIn the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full "AP" Calculus, where the "AP" stands for "Advanced Placement" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College). | tensor([-4.7873,  4.3970])
The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical.\n\nHere's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html\n\n"In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. | tensor([-4.5512,  4.0776])
Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. | tensor([-4.6808,  4.1847])
As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. | tensor([-5.0582,  4.7111])
Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. | tensor([-4.0285,  3.5159])
People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. | tensor([-5.1103,  4.9154])
\n\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. | tensor([-4.7333,  4.2941])
So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. | tensor([-5.0616,  4.7157])
Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. | tensor([-5.0549,  4.7071])
They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. | tensor([-4.9769,  4.5895])
One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \n\nThen | tensor([-5.1295,  4.8935])
an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. | tensor([-5.1063,  4.8074])
He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. | tensor([-5.1271,  4.8840])
He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. | tensor([-5.0497,  4.6986])
Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\n\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. | tensor([-4.7598,  4.3374])

\n\n\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. | tensor([-4.8690,  4.4575])

  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear). | tensor([-3.9366,  3.4658])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up, and world demand for energy increases, the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.\nIncidentally, solar power is another source used in California, but it's provided by individuals, not power companies. | tensor([-4.8130,  4.3982])

While historically the use of the semicolon and colon were similar, modern usage seems to be diverging, with semicolons indicating breaks slightly stronger than commas and colons introducing lists and explanations. | tensor([-3.9986,  3.4780])

  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
That is, the semicolon introduces greater breaks in the sentence, dividing clauses which are longer and more independent, while commas are reserved for short pauses and for separating lists of short items.\nContinuing up the continuum, colons are "weightier" than semicolons, but less so than periods. | tensor([-3.0380,  2.7197])

Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. | tensor([-4.6657,  4.1691])
When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn "incentivizes" people to answer questions. | tensor([-5.0798,  4.7605])
And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased.\n\nSee my answer to the question, "Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?":\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767\n\nOn the issue of the term "incentivize"--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process. | tensor([-4.3799,  3.9087])

The basic answer is indie (or independent) music is music that is released on smaller labels that operate independently from the mainstream music business.\n\nBut more often "indie" refers to a specific genre of contemporary music that is based on combining aesthetics of classic rock, punk, garage and art rock. | tensor([-5.0864,  4.7780])

Folksonomy is a word formed from a combination of "folk" and "taxonomy". | tensor([-3.3478,  2.9429])

It's a recently developed concept of the general public categorizing information according to what's most useful for the masses, and is considered in opposition to the sometimes more formal classification systems created by an entity such as the Library of Congress or Yahoo!.\n\nFolksonomies are often implemented using tags.   | tensor([-3.2275,  2.8710])

Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. | tensor([-4.8148,  4.3977])
It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or "snoop" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or "inject" unwelcome traffic as well. | tensor([-4.1966,  3.6872])
However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. | tensor([-4.3030,  3.8028])
For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. | tensor([-4.9698,  4.6324])
Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. | tensor([-4.9217,  4.5338])
Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. | tensor([-4.5089,  4.0348])
The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now "secure enough" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. | tensor([-3.8979,  3.4423])
Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or "encrypt" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. | tensor([-4.8385,  4.4436])
Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. | tensor([-4.5790,  4.1244])

It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). | tensor([-3.7778,  3.2839])
Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. | tensor([-4.5603,  4.0804])
At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. | tensor([-4.7445,  4.2781])
This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. | tensor([-4.6824,  4.2061])
Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. | tensor([-3.4966,  3.0587])
The best article I've read on the subject is in the link below.   | tensor([-4.3779,  3.8320])

I'd say yes, all high schools should offer SAT test prep. | tensor([-3.7163,  3.2216])
The main two reasons:\n\n1) | tensor([-4.4096,  3.8832])

\n\nBasically, college grads earn twice as much money as high school grads. | tensor([-4.7962,  4.3639])
This increased income provides more security, support to raise a family, and the means for furthering ones education.\n\n2) College grads have access to better jobs as many jobs require a college degree. | tensor([-4.9824,  4.6170])
The Corleones are more powerful, hands down.\n\nand for one reason, alone: The Sopranos don't have the muscle to take out the heads of all five crime families in one swoop and live to tell about it, including the big man in Vegas and take over his operation. | tensor([-4.9638,  4.6244])
The Corleons are a much bigger organization with a wider network.\n\nHead to head war, \nCorleones (GF1) vs. Sopranos (S1):\nVito (or Michael) Corleone vs. Tony Soprano\nSonny vs. Christopher\nClemenza vs. Silvio\nTessio vs. Paulie\nFredo vs. Big Pussy\nBarzini vs. Junior\nand Kay vs. Carmela :-) | tensor([-3.3631,  2.9901])
As a dutchman, and someone who's 6'4" I should be able to answer this one.\n\nSpecifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this, the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being "the tallest nation in the world".\n\nThe average dutchman is about 6'1" (4" taller than the avg american)\n\nResearch shows it to be a combo of genetics, disease prevention, diet (dairy, etc.) , average wealth & wellbeing, as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height.\n\nSo to summarize: drink your milk, get your shots, be happy and grow grow grow.. | tensor([-3.6784,  3.2226])
oh and a bit of genetics.\n\nFrom a research report:\n\nGenetic factors are evident in marked regional differences between the north and the south of the Netherlands. | tensor([-3.2071,  2.8608])
In the north, boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. | tensor([-2.7376,  2.5473])
The populations are relatively stable, and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian, whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. | tensor([ 3.1661, -2.8622])
However, although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch, they are taller than in their countries of origin. | tensor([-2.8631,  2.6198])
Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch, the world's highest consumers of dairy products. | tensor([ 3.4886, -3.0406])
Fredriks, one of the researchers in the recent study, emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example, the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children.\n\nLastly it's the healthcare system and wealth, every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. | tensor([ 1.5163, -1.9057])
It's been shown that wealth has a direct impact on height.. | tensor([-5.0737,  4.7265])

There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. | tensor([-3.2020,  2.8577])
Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. | tensor([-3.8419,  3.3388])
But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. | tensor([-5.0792,  4.7732])
What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. | tensor([-4.7190,  4.2527])
He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. | tensor([-3.6905,  3.1825])
His theory is contraversial, but it's worth a try. | tensor([-5.1294,  4.9026])
You may want to test that theory. | tensor([-4.9248,  4.5014])
\n\nThe program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. | tensor([-3.6845,  3.1926])
It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster. | tensor([ 2.5572, -2.5027])
\n\nOne theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth, like grinding sound of moving rocks. | tensor([-4.5668,  4.1054])

Permutation\nSuppose we want to find the number of ways to arrange the three letters in the word CAT in different two-letter groups where CA is different from AC and there are no repeated letters.\n\nBecause order matters, we're finding the number of permutations of size 2 that can be taken from a set of size 3. | tensor([-4.2866,  3.7953])
This is often written 3_P_2. | tensor([-5.0383,  4.6386])
We can list them as:\n\n      CA   CT   AC   AT    | tensor([-4.6837,  4.2129])
TC   TA\n\nCombination\nWhen we want to find the number of combinations of size 2 without repeated letters that can be made from the three letters in the word CAT, order doesn't matter; AT is the same as TA. | tensor([-3.7548,  3.2840])

the last (2004) FIFA best player of the world is Ronaldinho (playing at barcelona, don't confuse with Ronaldo, playing at Real Madrid). | tensor([-4.5820,  4.0699])

But truth is that, at this moment of the season, Ronaldinho is one step above the rest, and playing in the current best team (barcelona) helps him a lot. | tensor([-5.0941,  4.8037])

Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:\n\nWhen you think a stock is going to go down... | tensor([-4.2020,  3.7180])
You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker.\n2. | tensor([-4.5796,  4.1036])
You sell those shares at today's price.\n3. | tensor([-3.2639,  2.9065])
You wait for the stock to go down.\n4. | tensor([-5.0538,  4.7106])
You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.\n5. | tensor([-3.8866,  3.3953])
You return the borrowed shares.\n6. | tensor([-4.2199,  3.7059])
You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.\nSteps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.\n\nThe advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down. | tensor([-4.5647,  4.1036])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
(With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)\n\nThe disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money. | tensor([-4.8648,  4.4649])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment. | tensor([-4.8814,  4.4658])

There are several means of successfully treating malaria if contracted, yet malaria is still one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developing world. | tensor([-4.4204,  3.9263])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
The reason is that most of these people are too poor to afford even basic preventative measures like bednets (which keeps malarial misquitoes from biting children in their sleep).\n\nBednets are important step to reducing the impact of malaria, because it is much more expensive to treat malaria once it is contracted than it is to prevent it via bednets, removing standing water, etc.\n\nThere are some efforts to find cheaper alternative treatments as well, including one promising one that comes from Chinese herbal medicine. | tensor([-2.6834,  2.5260])

Answers to this question can vary greatly, but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation.   | tensor([-5.0705,  4.7448])

  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\n\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high. | tensor([-4.6131,  4.1938])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming. | tensor([-4.5252,  4.0180])

  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\n\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\n\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\n\nwhere | tensor([-4.5017,  4.0246])

 \n\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\n\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\n\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year. | tensor([-4.3096,  3.8258])

Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\n\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\n\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\n\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill. | tensor([-3.2996,  2.9841])

This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\n\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000. | tensor([-3.7665,  3.3301])

As mud?\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\n\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%). | tensor([-4.6136,  4.1847])

With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.   | tensor([-5.0698,  4.7607])

The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\n\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.   | tensor([-4.6727,  4.2187])

Stock option grants and stock grants are two forms of compensation often offered as incentives in addition to base salary offered to a newly hired employee. | tensor([-4.6944,  4.2293])
This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. | tensor([-5.1306,  4.8602])
\n\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. | tensor([-4.5398,  4.0640])

Employers grant call options to employees. | tensor([-3.8806,  3.3657])
Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. | tensor([-3.1658,  2.8109])
This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. | tensor([-3.7586,  3.2781])
Let's say it's after four years now. | tensor([-3.2219,  2.8195])
Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. | tensor([-3.4795,  3.0590])
Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. | tensor([-3.6188,  3.1793])
Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. | tensor([-3.5248,  3.0852])
So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. | tensor([-4.2034,  3.7012])
But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\n\nStock grants are simpler to understand. | tensor([-4.5839,  4.1325])
The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. | tensor([-4.8420,  4.4041])

Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. | tensor([-3.1851,  2.8654])
At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\n\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. | tensor([-4.5241,  4.0565])
That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. | tensor([-3.8093,  3.3252])
A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. | tensor([-4.6967,  4.2571])

Going out to eat is traditionally what is done on an anniversary, but I prefer one on one time where there is nobody else around. | tensor([-2.5310,  2.4914])
No strangers talking loudly, no waiters to interrupt, no time wasted in line or in the car. | tensor([-2.6186,  2.4143])

\n\nIn my opinion, Anniversaries are about each other, and to do that, you've gotta block out the rest of the world.   | tensor([-2.2278,  2.3197])
Here's my recipe for a fabulous anniversary. | tensor([ 4.8297, -4.3876])
FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. | tensor([-3.2184,  2.8625])
I'll tell you why in a little bit.\n\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). | tensor([-3.9362,  3.4579])
Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles. | tensor([-2.2858,  2.1406])
 Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\n\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. | tensor([ 3.3162, -2.9624])
Knee to knee, and eye to eye. | tensor([-4.1680,  3.6504])
Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. | tensor([-4.1617,  3.6395])
Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. | tensor([-4.6401,  4.1514])
Before you know it, hours will have passed. | tensor([-5.0746,  4.7142])
Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. | tensor([ 4.7710, -4.2992])
You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. | tensor([-2.8049,  2.5697])
\n\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. | tensor([-4.2110,  3.6912])
How they make you feel, and why you love them. | tensor([-2.2916,  2.3541])
Why you appreciate them. | tensor([-2.6002,  2.4996])
The more specific you get the better. | tensor([-4.7223,  4.2209])
For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. | tensor([-5.0608,  4.7549])
Now don't let the other person read it. | tensor([-3.3619,  2.9107])
Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. | tensor([ 4.5839, -4.0144])
It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. | tensor([-2.2504,  2.3085])
\n\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\n\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\n\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think? | tensor([ 2.1940, -2.1835])

Well, search engines like Yahoo! | tensor([ 1.9857, -2.0300])
and Google try to be something like that | tensor([ 4.0067, -3.4375])
but, of course, they can only be approximate. | tensor([-4.9153,  4.4749])

How would an indexer/table-of-contents-compiler know what to add? | tensor([-3.9324,  3.4044])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
The best that the search engines can do is something called "crawling" the web, looking for new pages.\n\nc) | tensor([-4.2838,  3.7795])
Some people don't WANT the rest of the world to know about their web pages. | tensor([ 3.2505, -2.9044])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
They just want a few people -- maybe just friends and family -- to be able to find the pages easily. | tensor([ 2.7983, -2.6643])
Part One\n(revised | tensor([-3.2658,  2.8477])
This is a single part of what will be, by my classification, about 240 compact tribal histories (contact to 1900). | tensor([-3.6376,  3.1639])

The normal process at this point is to circulate an almost finished product among a peer group for comment and criticism.\n\nUsing the Internet, this can be more inclusive. | tensor([-3.5990,  3.1382])
Feel free to comment or suggest corrections via e-mail. | tensor([-2.8441,  2.5550])
Working together we can end some of the historical misinformation about Native Americans. | tensor([-3.3781,  2.9767])

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. | tensor([-1.9336,  2.0297])
The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. | tensor([-2.3696,  2.3530])
Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\n\nPopulation\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. | tensor([-2.9909,  2.7276])
How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. | tensor([-3.1199,  2.7907])
A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. | tensor([-2.9164,  2.6750])
The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. | tensor([-3.2223,  2.8405])
No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. | tensor([ 1.9692, -2.0040])
The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. | tensor([-2.5043,  2.2721])
Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. | tensor([-3.0160,  2.7166])
Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\n\n\nName\nThe | tensor([-2.3551,  2.3996])

" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). | tensor([-2.4491,  2.4141])
Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\n\n\nLanguage\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\n\n\nSub-tribes\n\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \nLower | tensor([-2.5051,  2.4371])

Massage therapy has been proven to be an efffective alternative relief for Lupus people suffering from Lupus.\n\nMassage is believed to be beneficial effects in several ways. | tensor([-3.0279,  2.7411])
Besides being physically and emotionally relaxing, massage improves blood and lymph circulation, reduces nerve irritation and brings fresh oxygen and other nutrients to the affected tissues. | tensor([-3.1485,  2.7903])
Massage may also cause the body to produce fewer stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine (formerly adrenalin), and may also increase the body's production of pain-killing endorphins and the mood-altering hormone serotonin.\n\n  While seeing a professional massage therapist is relatively expensive, a friend or family member may be able to learn enough technique from a book or video to provide some relief for you. | tensor([-2.2433,  2.3058])

There are at least 3 types of beta receptors in the body - beta 1, 2, and 3 - and they are sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine. | tensor([-3.0508,  2.7389])
beta 1 controls heart rate and force of contraction in the heart (an increase in these will increase blood pressure, thus blocking them will lower blood pressure). | tensor([-2.9865,  2.7110])
beta 2 controls smooth muscle many places in the body. | tensor([-4.6043,  4.1091])

A gas-operated firearm operates on a similar principle of a car engine. | tensor([-3.7895,  3.3023])
When a round is fired, expanding gases propel the bullet out of the barrel, along with most of the gas. | tensor([-4.8100,  4.3334])
But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. | tensor([-4.1335,  3.6302])
A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. | tensor([-4.4052,  3.8763])
When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. | tensor([-4.2707,  3.7436])
The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. | tensor([-4.3175,  3.8116])
the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight. | tensor([-4.6064,  4.1361])

A cloud compsition is primarlly just billions of drops of water or ice. | tensor([-3.1361,  2.7993])

When such a cloud formation has an influx of water/ice, ie it's mass increases to include more water/ice, light finds it hard to pass through the mass, thus making it darker for us to see.\n\nIn a normal cloud, light can pass through the water/ice within the cloud and we see it as a distorted white/bluish/greyish/greenish hue. | tensor([-3.6314,  3.1755])

Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, is one of the most joyous times of the Jewish year. | tensor([-3.4162,  2.9548])
\n\nThe reason for the celebration is twofold (both dating back to c. 165 BCE): \n\nthe miraculous military victory of the small, ill-equipped Jewish army over the ruling Greek Syrians, who had banned the Jewish religion and desecrated the Temple; \n\nand the miracle of the small cruse of consecrated oil, which burned for eight days in the Temple's menorah instead of just one. \n\n\nHanukkah is celebrated by: \n\na. lighting a menorah for eight nights with olive oil or wax candles; one on the first night and an additional one each succeeding night \n\nb. | tensor([-2.4671,  2.4084])

  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\n\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. | tensor([-4.1438,  3.6572])

At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\n\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. | tensor([-4.4575,  3.9786])

Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. | tensor([ 1.6382, -1.9041])
As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. | tensor([-4.2761,  3.7831])
Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. | tensor([-2.9171,  2.6390])
Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a "feed").\n\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. | tensor([-2.2184,  2.2717])
There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). | tensor([-3.7177,  3.2510])

Free readers are available as well; a search for "RSS Reader" at popular search sites will yield many results.\n\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). | tensor([-2.0431,  2.1535])

It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\n\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. | tensor([-4.9037,  4.5203])

Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. | tensor([-4.6481,  4.1841])
The trade-off made is convenience for speed. | tensor([-5.1377,  4.8969])
Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. | tensor([-5.0223,  4.6693])
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. | tensor([-4.9384,  4.5133])
Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. | tensor([-5.1230,  4.8702])
Their work has yet to be completed. | tensor([-3.8714,  3.3252])
The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. | tensor([-4.7765,  4.3338])
Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. | tensor([-3.6822,  3.2055])
Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. | tensor([-4.4301,  3.9054])
Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. | tensor([-5.1229,  4.8542])
These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. | tensor([-2.8676,  2.6048])
If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. | tensor([-4.5841,  4.1118])
This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. | tensor([-4.4824,  4.0197])
The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. | tensor([-5.0499,  4.7092])
This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. | tensor([-4.0575,  3.5490])
Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. | tensor([-4.7671,  4.3469])

Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. | tensor([-4.3130,  3.8036])
Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). | tensor([ 1.9452, -2.1164])
The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. | tensor([-2.1335,  2.2281])
We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. | tensor([ 1.1155, -1.3762])
It is contained in our mitochandria. | tensor([-3.8242,  3.2845])
Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. | tensor([-2.0507,  1.9871])
The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. | tensor([ 3.0348, -2.7951])
So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. | tensor([ 2.3453, -2.3812])
Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. | tensor([ 2.5729, -2.5952])
Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key "markers" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. | tensor([ 2.8626, -2.7227])
So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. | tensor([-2.8451,  2.6001])
These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. | tensor([ 2.1420, -2.2357])
Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. | tensor([-1.3967,  1.1060])
Let me give you an example. | tensor([-4.6771,  4.1812])
Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. | tensor([-3.3224,  2.8991])
An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. | tensor([ 2.1396, -2.2093])
Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. | tensor([ 2.4534, -2.4172])
Others will not be so lucky. | tensor([ 2.1215, -2.2955])
If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. | tensor([ 3.0902, -2.8420])
The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. | tensor([-3.3686,  2.9154])
If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. | tensor([-2.9538,  2.6733])
More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. | tensor([-2.3763,  2.3284])
From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are. | tensor([ 3.0932, -2.8223])

"Mikołaj Kopernik (February 19, 1473–May 24, 1543), more commonly known by the Latin form Nicolaus Copernicus, was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and economist, mainly remembered for developing a scientifically useful heliocentric (Sun-centered) theory of the solar system. | tensor([-4.6912,  4.2215])

Passion\n\nI've received the question about motivation to workout several times. | tensor([-4.8505,  4.4205])
A bit back, I emailed a fellow who simply wished the question of motivation could be answered.\n\nI think the 2 most frequently asked questions that I address in my Beginners' Guide to Fitness and Bodybuilding are:\n\n1) | tensor([-4.3847,  3.8817])
How do I get motivated?\n2) | tensor([-5.1332,  4.8901])
How soon can I expect to see results?\n\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\n\nPassion\n\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\n\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. | tensor([-4.3876,  3.9201])
Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. | tensor([ 2.5277, -2.4885])
Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\n\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. | tensor([-5.0444,  4.7281])
It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. | tensor([-4.5179,  4.0152])
Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. | tensor([-4.9619,  4.6007])
So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. | tensor([-4.8917,  4.4821])
Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. | tensor([-5.0544,  4.7541])
In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\n\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out. | tensor([-3.9913,  3.5082])

It may actually hurt you FICO score.\n\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. | tensor([-5.0447,  4.7192])
So, let's take a look at an example:\n\n$200 total credit available\n$175 total credit used\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\n\n$5000 total credit available\n$1000 total credit used\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\n\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. | tensor([-4.3242,  3.8616])
Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\n\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. | tensor([-4.0650,  3.5844])
So it doesn’t matter what you do with them as long as you don’t stop paying them.\n\nIt’s best to just hold on to them. | tensor([-4.1724,  3.6927])
You might even consider having the credit limit taken up (but don’t max them out). | tensor([-4.7976,  4.3662])
It’s not how much of a limit you have that’s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you’re | tensor([-4.8956,  4.5005])
using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. | tensor([-4.5770,  4.1455])
To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you’re likely to just cancel it. | tensor([-5.0743,  4.7593])
Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you’re worth.\n\nHope this helps. | tensor([-4.2579,  3.7647])

& I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :) | tensor([-3.9432,  3.4108])
\n\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. | tensor([ 2.9436, -2.7951])
He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity... | tensor([-3.8146,  3.2802])
don't know why. | tensor([-4.4102,  3.8459])
Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. | tensor([-5.1264,  4.8533])
Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of "bad nasties". | tensor([ 3.0974, -2.8271])
I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store... | tensor([-2.4146,  2.3308])
Victoria's Secret, to be exact. | tensor([ 4.2973, -3.7057])
My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. | tensor([-2.6529,  2.5071])
He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. | tensor([-4.8744,  4.4241])
It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. | tensor([-5.0674,  4.7128])
But it just hit me oddly. | tensor([-5.0508,  4.6278])
I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it... | tensor([ 3.2342, -2.9036])
that's what started the whole process. | tensor([-4.9490,  4.4703])
By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. | tensor([ 2.9894, -2.7031])
I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. | tensor([-2.1608,  2.1394])
Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. | tensor([ 4.0285, -3.4669])
So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want... | tensor([-3.3005,  2.9227])
I'm not kidding. | tensor([-4.2349,  3.6939])
True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating | tensor([ 4.5113, -3.9344])
but I also don't beat myself up about it. | tensor([-4.7470,  4.2526])
If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. | tensor([ 4.6750, -4.1210])
When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. | tensor([ 4.8962, -4.5186])
The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. | tensor([ 3.5785, -3.1089])
I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. | tensor([ 2.9593, -2.7621])
As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. | tensor([-4.7330,  4.2805])
So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. | tensor([ 3.3411, -2.9568])
Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) | tensor([ 2.5877, -2.5722])
I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes | tensor([-2.0218,  2.1019])
where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. | tensor([-3.3439,  2.9607])
I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. | tensor([-2.3270,  1.9789])
I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages... | tensor([ 4.4530, -3.8728])
OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. | tensor([-4.8885,  4.4438])
It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! | tensor([ 2.1949, -2.2860])
But you know what? | tensor([-3.3695,  2.9638])
I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! | tensor([-3.0423,  2.7445])
That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all | tensor([-3.6045,  3.1358])
you should be able to access your pop account through webmail. | tensor([ 2.8616, -2.7182])
if you have your own domain, you should be able to access a control panel where you can check webmail through programs like Horde and squirrelmail.\n\nif it is a work account, talk to a tech person at your work to find out how you can access the account using a browser.\n\nmost ISPs (earthlink, verizon) also have webmail features. | tensor([-3.3645,  2.9886])

It's the best introduction to the language that I've found. | tensor([-5.0991,  4.7578])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
You may be able to find one at your local library. | tensor([-5.1009,  4.7836])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
If not, take a look at TheJapanShop.net or Amazon.com or JList.com | tensor([-2.1438,  2.2193])
I wouldn't recommend that you do that. | tensor([-4.8146,  4.3049])

A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about "learning" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think. | tensor([-5.0282,  4.6914])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used. | tensor([-4.5826,  4.0844])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language). | tensor([-3.1991,  2.8104])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. | tensor([-3.4520,  3.0224])
Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. | tensor([-4.8829,  4.4777])

unless the cracking is painful, it is not unusual or dangerous for your knees to "crack".\n\nLunges are excellent for strengthening the muscles around the knee joint. | tensor([-5.1414,  4.8862])
Make sure that you are not leaning over the knee, that the knee is right above the foot during the lunge and that you maintain a straight upright movement.\n\nDo not do hamstring excercises that will pull on the knee joint if you have problems with your knee. | tensor([-5.1020,  4.8075])
\n\nelipticals are good for running on with minimal knee and ankle stress. | tensor([-4.7554,  4.2701])
\n\nyou can also get large elastic bands...stand in them, and step out to the side pulling on the bands, then back in. | tensor([-4.5479,  4.0763])
Don't pull harder than is comfortable, this will help increase the stablization of the knee.\n\nLaying on your back you can pull your knee to your chest, and then extend it, locking your knee holding the leg just over the ground..repeating, this will also help strengthen the muscles around the knee with minimal weight on it.\n\nAlways is good to speak with a doctor or physical therapist if you have concerns. | tensor([-5.0180,  4.6801])

Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\nOrganization of the Empire\n\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. | tensor([-2.7007,  2.5124])
Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. | tensor([-3.4497,  3.0407])
Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\n\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. | tensor([-3.3024,  2.9071])
Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. | tensor([-4.5379,  4.0214])
Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. | tensor([-4.8880,  4.4553])
The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. | tensor([-3.4909,  3.0294])
When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\n\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). | tensor([-4.6812,  4.2088])
The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\n\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. | tensor([-3.9708,  3.4757])

They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. | tensor([-2.9284,  2.6101])
The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\n\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. | tensor([-2.4801,  2.4486])

The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. | tensor([-2.9567,  2.6491])
The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. | tensor([-4.3948,  3.8652])
Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. | tensor([-3.2485,  2.8614])
The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. | tensor([-3.5815,  3.1231])

This is a true question of semantics and religion. | tensor([-4.4631,  3.9403])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.   | tensor([-2.5218,  2.4381])
Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice. | tensor([ 2.5541, -2.5461])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called "faith" and the controlling of culture through that so-called "faith"...thereby falling into suspicion of "satanic" influences. | tensor([-2.3423,  2.2311])
  | tensor([ 1.6755, -2.2866])
It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\n\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.   | tensor([-2.3101,  2.3276])

A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a "pure" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned. | tensor([-4.5922,  4.1227])

Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance. | tensor([-4.7673,  4.3381])

Ecotourism is loosely defined as nature-based tourist experiences, whereby visitors travel to regions for the sole purpose of appreciating their natural beauty.\n\nHard ecotourism is intense sometimes strenuous ecotourism that may involve non-hotel accommodations. | tensor([-3.2840,  2.9131])
It tends toward longer, specialized trips by small groups within a wilderness or semi-wilderness setting mediated by minimal services; also called active, deep or eco-specialist ecotourism, this constitutes only a very small portion of the total ecotourism sector.\n\nSoft ecotourism is the most common form, where tourists hope to observe nature and culture closely, but casually. | tensor([-3.9032,  3.4261])
It is technically defined as ecotourism that tends toward shorter, multi-purpose trips within well-serviced areas frequented by large numbers of ecotourists; also called passive, shallow or popular or eco-generalist ecotourism, this accounts for most ecotourism activity. | tensor([-4.0644,  3.5873])

Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. | tensor([-5.1357,  4.9127])
Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\n\nTime is often referred to as the "fourth dimension". | tensor([-4.4725,  3.9670])
It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. | tensor([-5.1298,  4.8389])
It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. | tensor([-5.1198,  4.7777])
The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\n\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. | tensor([-5.0133,  4.6623])
As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size. | tensor([-4.4011,  3.8587])
